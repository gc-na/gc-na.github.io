# Abstract

**VLSI Wiki** is my dictionary that encompasses all knowledge related to semiconductors and VLSI—from fundamental theories to the latest technology trends.  

I've always had many questions:
> "What does this term mean?"  
> "How should I choose my career path?"  
> "What if I make a mistake?"  

With a variety of concerns on my mind, I decided to create this website to share my journey and address your questions—ultimately contributing to the semiconductor industry.
