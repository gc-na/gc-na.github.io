# 3D Design Flow (Taiwanese)

## Definition of 3D Design Flow

3D Design Flow refers to the systematic process involved in designing three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) and semiconductor devices. This design methodology integrates various stages, including architecture design, circuit design, physical design, verification, and manufacturing, optimizing performance, area, and power consumption. The 3D Design Flow is crucial for advancing semiconductor technology, enabling higher integration density and improved functionality in modern electronic devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of 3D IC design emerged in the late 1990s as a response to the limitations of traditional 2D scaling methods, driven by Moore's Law. Early implementations primarily focused on stacking multiple chips vertically to reduce interconnect delays and improve performance. Technological advancements, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs), have significantly contributed to the feasibility and efficiency of 3D integrated circuits. The continued evolution of packaging technologies and materials science has also played a vital role in enhancing the 3D Design Flow.
