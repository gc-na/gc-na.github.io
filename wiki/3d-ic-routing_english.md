# 3D IC Routing (English)

## Definition of 3D IC Routing

3D IC Routing refers to the design and implementation of interconnections within three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), which stack multiple layers of semiconductor devices vertically. This advanced form of circuit design allows for shorter signal paths, reduced power consumption, and increased integration density compared to traditional two-dimensional integrated circuits (2D ICs). The routing process in 3D ICs involves carefully planning and optimizing the paths through which electrical signals traverse between various components distributed across multiple layers.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of 3D IC technology can be traced back to the early 1990s when researchers began exploring vertical integration as a means to overcome the limitations of traditional planar technologies. Initial efforts focused on packaging technologies, such as chip-on-chip (CoC) configurations, which laid the groundwork for the development of more sophisticated 3D IC architectures.

Significant advancements in wafer bonding techniques, through-silicon vias (TSVs), and interlayer dielectric materials have facilitated the fabrication of 3D ICs. The introduction of TSVs, which allow for vertical electrical connections between stacked die, was pivotal in enhancing routing capabilities. As fabrication techniques matured, the industry began to witness the commercialization of 3D ICs in applications ranging from high-performance computing to mobile devices.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)

TSVs are vertical interconnects that serve as the primary method for achieving electrical communication between different layers of a 3D IC. They play a critical role in minimizing signal delay and enhancing performance. Proper design of TSVs is essential for effective routing, as their placement can significantly impact the overall signal integrity and thermal performance of the IC.

### Interconnect Materials

The materials used for interconnects in 3D ICs differ from traditional copper interconnects due to the unique challenges posed by vertical stacking. Emerging materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, are being explored for their superior electrical and thermal properties, which may enable more efficient routing.

### Design Tools and Methodologies

The design of 3D IC routing requires specialized Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools that can handle the complexities of multiple layers and TSV placements. Techniques such as Floorplanning, Placement, and Routing must be adapted to account for the z-dimension, ensuring efficient use of space and minimizing signal delay.
