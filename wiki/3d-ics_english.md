# 3D ICs (English)

## Definition of 3D ICs

Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) refer to semiconductor devices where multiple layers of integrated circuits are stacked vertically, interconnected through vertical vias, or through-silicon vias (TSVs). This configuration allows for higher density integration, improved performance, and reduced latency compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) integrated circuits. By assembling multiple layers of transistors and passive components, 3D ICs enable enhanced functionality while minimizing the footprint of the device.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of 3D IC technology emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the limitations of Moore's Law and the growing demand for miniaturization in electronic devices. Early developments in 3D packaging technologies, such as chip stacking and multi-chip modules, laid the groundwork for more complex 3D IC architectures. 

In the early 2000s, advancements in fabrication processes, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) and microbumps, facilitated the integration of multiple silicon layers. The introduction of TSV technology allowed for vertical electrical connections between layers, significantly improving signal integrity and reducing interconnect lengths.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Vertical Interconnects

Vertical interconnects are crucial for the functionality of 3D ICs. TSVs are the most prominent technology in this domain, where cylindrical conduits are etched through silicon wafers. These vias allow for high-density interconnections between the stacked die.

### Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP)

Wafer-level packaging is another related technology that assists in the development of 3D ICs. WLP involves packaging at the wafer level before dicing, which can lead to smaller package sizes and improved electrical performance.

### Heterogeneous Integration

Heterogeneous integration refers to the combination of different materials and device types within a single 3D IC. This can include integrating silicon with other semiconductor materials like gallium nitride (GaN) or silicon carbide (SiC), enabling specialized applications such as power electronics and RF devices.
