# 3D Interconnect (English)

## Definition of 3D Interconnect

3D Interconnect refers to a technology that enables the vertical integration of electronic components, allowing multiple layers of integrated circuits (ICs) to be interconnected in three dimensions. This approach enhances performance, decreases footprint, and improves power efficiency by facilitating shorter interconnect lengths and reducing parasitic capacitance and inductance compared to traditional 2D interconnects. 

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of 3D integration emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the limitations of planar scaling, driven by Moore's Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a chip approximately every two years. Early developments in 3D IC technology focused on stacking dies and utilizing through-silicon vias (TSVs) to create vertical connections. By the early 2000s, significant advancements were made in fabrication techniques, enabling the mass production of 3D integrated circuits.

One of the notable milestones in 3D interconnect technology was the introduction of TSVs, which allow for high-density vertical interconnections. This innovation paved the way for heterogeneous integration, where different types of components, such as sensors, memory, and processors, can be integrated into a single package, thus enhancing functionality and reducing latency.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)

TSVs are vertical electrical connections that pass through silicon wafers or dies, facilitating communication between stacked ICs. Their small diameter and high aspect ratio enable high-density interconnects, which is crucial for 3D integration.

### Microbumps

Microbumps are small solder connections that provide electrical interconnects between adjacent dies. They are typically used in conjunction with TSVs to improve the mechanical stability and electrical performance of stacked ICs.

### Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP)

WLP is a packaging technology that allows for the integration of circuits at the wafer level, providing a compact and efficient packaging solution for 3D ICs. This technology reduces the overall size and enhances the performance of electronic devices.

### 3D System-on-Chip (3D SoC)

3D SoCs combine various functionalities—such as digital, analog, and RF circuits—onto a single chip in a 3D architecture. This integration improves overall system performance and efficiency.
