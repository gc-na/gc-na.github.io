# 3D NAND (English)

## Definition of 3D NAND

3D NAND is a type of non-volatile memory technology that allows for data storage in a three-dimensional structure. Unlike traditional planar NAND flash memory, which arranges memory cells in a two-dimensional layout, 3D NAND stacks memory cells vertically in multiple layers. This innovation significantly increases storage density and performance while reducing the cost per gigabyte, making it a pivotal advancement in the realm of flash memory technologies.

## Historical Background

The evolution of NAND flash memory can be traced back to the late 1980s, with the introduction of planar NAND. As digital data needs surged, the limitations of planar NAND became evident, prompting the need for new technologies. The transition to 3D NAND began in earnest in the early 2010s, spearheaded by advancements in semiconductor fabrication techniques. In 2012, Samsung became the first company to announce the development of 3D NAND technology, subsequently releasing it in commercial products.

Subsequent years saw multiple manufacturers, including Micron, Intel, and Western Digital, joining the 3D NAND race, leading to rapid technological advancements and market growth. By stacking cells in layers, manufacturers have been able to enhance performance metrics significantly while addressing challenges such as cell interference and heat dissipation.

## Engineering Fundamentals of 3D NAND

### Structure and Design

The architecture of 3D NAND typically consists of memory cells built in vertical stacks. These cells are arranged in layers, with innovations in cell design, such as charge trap layers and floating gates, enabling improved retention and endurance. The most prominent designs include:

- **Charge Trap Flash (CTF)**: Utilizes a dielectric layer to trap charge, enabling better scalability and reduced leakage.
- **Floating Gate Flash**: Traditional design where a floating gate stores charge, but with modifications to accommodate the 3D stacking.

### Fabrication Techniques

The fabrication of 3D NAND involves various advanced processes, including:

- **Selective Epitaxial Growth**: Crucial for creating the vertical structures.
- **Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)**: Used for depositing thin films with precision, critical for the formation of dielectric layers.
- **Etching and Lithography**: Essential for defining structures at the nanoscale, allowing the intricate design necessary for 3D configurations.
