# 3D Packaging Solutions (Taiwanese)

## Definition of 3D Packaging Solutions

3D Packaging Solutions refer to advanced packaging technologies that integrate multiple semiconductor devices into a single package, enhancing functionality, reducing size, and improving performance. By stacking chips vertically or horizontally, these solutions allow for increased interconnectivity and reduced signal delay, which are critical in high-performance applications such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), memory modules, and system-on-chip (SoC) designs.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of 3D packaging began in the late 20th century, driven by the demand for miniaturization in electronic devices. Early attempts at 3D packaging utilized wire bonding, but limitations in performance and thermal management led to the development of more sophisticated techniques like Through-Silicon Via (TSV) and Micro-Bump interconnections. Taiwan emerged as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing and packaging, leveraging its robust supply chain and technological expertise to pioneer innovations in 3D packaging.
