# 3D Stacking (English)

## Definition of 3D Stacking
3D stacking refers to a semiconductor packaging technology that involves vertically integrating multiple chips or dies into a single package. The primary goal of 3D stacking is to enhance performance, reduce the footprint, and improve the power efficiency of integrated circuits. This technique allows for the creation of high-density and high-performance systems by stacking memory, logic, and other components in a three-dimensional architecture, facilitating shorter interconnects and improved signal integrity.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of 3D stacking can be traced back to the early 2000s, with initial efforts focused on increasing memory density through techniques like Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs). TSVs are vertical electrical connections that pass through silicon wafers, enabling communication between stacked chips. Over the years, advances in microfabrication techniques, such as wafer thinning, bonding technologies, and improved TSV fabrication, have propelled the development of 3D stacking. 

In 2011, the introduction of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) by AMD and SK Hynix marked a significant milestone in 3D stacking technology, demonstrating its potential for enhancing memory bandwidth and energy efficiency in high-performance computing applications.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
### 3D vs 2D Integration
While traditional 2D integration places chips side by side on a single plane, 3D stacking takes advantage of vertical space, allowing for more compact designs. The main differences include:
- **Interconnect Length:** 3D stacking significantly reduces interconnect lengths, which minimizes latency and power consumption.
- **Thermal Management:** 3D designs pose unique thermal challenges, requiring advanced cooling solutions to manage heat dissipation.
- **Manufacturing Complexity:** 3D stacking involves more complex fabrication processes, including wafer-level packaging and die bonding.

### Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)
TSVs are a critical component of 3D stacking technology. They are small, vertical conduits that connect different layers of silicon dies, enabling electrical signals to pass through them. TSVs are essential for maintaining high-speed data transfer and are often accompanied by micro-bumps for electrical interconnections.

### Microbumps and Wafer Bonding
Microbumps play a crucial role in the interconnection of stacked dies. These tiny solder bumps facilitate electrical connections between the layers while minimizing the footprint. Wafer bonding technologies, such as direct bonding and adhesive bonding, are used to securely stack the dies while maintaining mechanical integrity.
