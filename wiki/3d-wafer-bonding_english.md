# 3D Wafer Bonding (English)

## Definition of 3D Wafer Bonding

3D Wafer Bonding is a semiconductor manufacturing technology that enables the vertical stacking of integrated circuits (ICs) on a single substrate or multiple substrates, thereby creating a three-dimensional structure. This technique allows for the direct bonding of silicon wafers or other materials at the atomic level, enhancing device performance by reducing interconnect distances, improving signal speed, and integrating heterogeneous materials. The process typically involves surface preparation, alignment, bonding, and annealing to achieve strong adhesion and ensure electrical connectivity between layers.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of wafer bonding emerged in the late 20th century as the semiconductor industry sought to address limitations in traditional 2D scaling. Early implementations primarily focused on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technologies, which provided benefits in terms of reduced parasitic capacitance and improved performance. However, significant advancements in materials science and microfabrication techniques have led to the development of various wafer bonding methods, including:

- **Anodic Bonding**: A technique that uses high voltage and heat to bond silicon wafers to glass or other substrates.
- **Fusion Bonding**: A method that relies on molecular forces to create a bond between two clean silicon surfaces without the use of any adhesives.
- **Adhesive Bonding**: Involves the use of polymeric materials or adhesives to bond wafers together, often allowing for greater flexibility in material selection.

Recent advances, such as the integration of advanced materials (e.g., III-V compounds, MEMS, and optical devices), have expanded the applicability of 3D wafer bonding in various fields, including consumer electronics, telecommunications, and medical devices.
