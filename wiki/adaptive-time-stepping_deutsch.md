# Adaptive Time Stepping (Deutsch)

## Definition of Adaptive Time Stepping

Adaptive Time Stepping (ATS) is a numerical technique used in computational simulations to dynamically adjust the time increment of numerical integration methods based on the solution's behavior. This approach allows for more efficient simulations by using smaller time steps when the solution changes rapidly and larger time steps when the solution is relatively stable. ATS is particularly beneficial in solving differential equations in various fields, including physics, engineering, and finance, where the dynamics of the system can vary significantly over time.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of time stepping in numerical simulations dates back to the development of early computational methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations. Traditional fixed time stepping methods, such as the Euler method and Runge-Kutta methods, have been widely used but often lead to inefficient computations, especially in systems with varying dynamics. The introduction of Adaptive Time Stepping techniques in the late 20th century marked a significant advancement in computational efficiency.

Notable contributions include the development of error control strategies and sophisticated algorithms that monitor the local truncation error to adjust time steps accordingly. The emergence of more complex systems requiring real-time simulations, such as those found in astrophysics and fluid dynamics, further propelled the advancement of ATS techniques.
