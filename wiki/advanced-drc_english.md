# Advanced DRC (English)

## Definition of Advanced DRC

Advanced Design Rule Checking (Advanced DRC) refers to the systematic verification process in the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs) that ensures adherence to specified design rules and standards. Unlike traditional DRC, which primarily checks for geometric adherence to manufacturing rules, Advanced DRC incorporates a multifaceted approach, evaluating not only geometrical constraints but also electrical and physical properties of the design. This technique is crucial in the era of sub-10nm technology nodes, where design complexity has surged, and traditional methods may prove insufficient.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Evolution of DRC

The concept of Design Rule Checking originated in the early days of semiconductor manufacturing when designers faced challenges in ensuring that their designs could be successfully fabricated. As manufacturing technology progressed, particularly with the advent of photolithography techniques, the requirements for DRC became more stringent. Traditional DRC methods focused on basic geometric checks, including spacing and width constraints, which were adequate for older technologies.

### Emergence of Advanced DRC

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, as the semiconductor industry transitioned to more complex designs, the limitations of traditional DRC became evident. The introduction of multi-patterning techniques and the need for high-density interconnects necessitated a new approach. Advanced DRC emerged as a response to these challenges, integrating sophisticated algorithms and simulation tools to ensure designs met not only fabrication requirements but also electrical performance criteria.

### Comparison: Traditional DRC vs. Advanced DRC

- **Traditional DRC**: Focuses primarily on geometric checks such as spacing rules, width rules, and layer overlaps. It operates on a layer-by-layer basis and is often limited to 2D checks.

- **Advanced DRC**: Includes geometric checks but extends to include electrical rule checks (ERC), parasitic extraction, and physical verification. It leverages 3D modeling, machine learning algorithms, and simulation tools to predict how designs will perform in real-world conditions, thereby significantly enhancing the reliability of the ICs.
