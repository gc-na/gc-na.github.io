# Advanced Node Characterization (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Advanced Node Characterization

Advanced Node Characterization refers to the process of evaluating and validating semiconductor devices designed and fabricated at technology nodes of 7nm and below. This involves the characterization of electrical, thermal, and reliability parameters to ensure that the devices meet the stringent performance and power specifications required for modern applications, including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and mobile devices. 

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Historically, semiconductor technology has evolved through several generations of manufacturing nodes, with each transition enabling greater integration density and performance improvements. The shift from planar technology to FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) structures at the 22nm node marked a significant turning point, enabling better control over short-channel effects and allowing for continued scaling down of device dimensions. 

As of 2023, the industry has embraced nodes as small as 3nm, incorporating advanced materials and processes such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and new high-k/metal gate stacks. These innovations have paved the way for Advanced Node Characterization, which is crucial for meeting the functional and reliability demands of next-generation semiconductor products.
