# Advanced Node Simulation (English)

## Definition of Advanced Node Simulation

Advanced Node Simulation refers to the computational methodologies and tools used to model, analyze, and predict the behavior of integrated circuits (ICs) fabricated using cutting-edge semiconductor technologies, typically at technology nodes of 7nm and below. These simulations are critical for validating design specifications, performance metrics, and manufacturability of complex Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs) before actual fabrication. The simulation processes encompass various aspects such as device physics, circuit behavior, thermal effects, and electromagnetic interference, ensuring that design challenges associated with scaling are effectively addressed.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The journey of Advanced Node Simulation began in the late 20th century with the introduction of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. As transistors were miniaturized, traditional simulation tools struggled to keep pace with the increasing complexity of VLSI systems. The introduction of 90nm technology nodes marked a significant milestone, as it necessitated the development of more sophisticated simulation tools capable of handling quantum effects, short-channel effects, and increased leakage currents.

By the time the industry approached the 7nm technology node, simulations evolved to incorporate FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) technology, which offered enhanced electrostatic control over the channel. These advancements allowed for more accurate modeling of device characteristics and improved performance predictions, leading to the development of new simulation algorithms and tools such as SPICE variants and Monte Carlo simulations.
