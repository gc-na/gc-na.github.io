# Analog IC Design (English)

## Definition of Analog IC Design

Analog Integrated Circuit (IC) Design refers to the process of creating electronic circuits that manipulate continuous signals, as opposed to discrete signals used in digital circuits. Analog ICs are essential for interfacing with the real world, processing signals such as audio, video, and sensor data. This discipline encompasses a variety of techniques and methodologies aimed at achieving desired performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, linearity, and power consumption.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of analog IC design can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the invention of the transistor in 1947. Early analog circuits were predominantly built using discrete components. However, the development of monolithic integrated circuits in the 1960s marked a significant milestone, allowing for miniaturization and enhanced performance. Over the subsequent decades, advancements in semiconductor fabrication technologies, such as CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and BiCMOS (Bipolar CMOS), have led to improved power efficiency and integration levels.
