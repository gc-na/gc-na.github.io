# Analog Signal Processing (English)

## Definition of Analog Signal Processing

Analog Signal Processing (ASP) refers to the manipulation of continuous-time signals, which are typically represented as voltage or current variations that correspond to physical phenomena. Unlike digital signal processing, which deals with discrete signals, ASP involves operations such as amplification, filtering, modulation, and demodulation of analog signals. These operations are performed using analog electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and operational amplifiers.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of Analog Signal Processing can be traced back to the early 20th century with the advent of radio technology. The development of vacuum tubes enabled the amplification of signals, which was essential for radio receivers. As technology progressed, transistors emerged in the mid-20th century, leading to a significant miniaturization of circuits and the introduction of integrated circuits (ICs).

### Evolution of Components

1. **Vacuum Tubes**: The first components used for amplification and signal processing.
2. **Transistors**: Introduced in the 1940s, transistors replaced vacuum tubes, offering better reliability and efficiency.
