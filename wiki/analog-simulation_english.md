# Analog Simulation (English)

## Definition of Analog Simulation

Analog Simulation refers to the process of modeling the behavior of analog circuits and systems using mathematical equations and computational methods. Unlike digital simulation, which deals with discrete values, analog simulation focuses on continuous signals and their variations over time. The primary goal is to emulate the physical behavior of analog components such as resistors, capacitors, and transistors, allowing engineers to analyze circuit performance before physical prototypes are built.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of analog simulation can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the advent of early electronic computers. The first significant advancements occurred with the introduction of operational amplifiers and the development of circuit simulation algorithms. The SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulator, developed in the 1970s at the University of California, Berkeley, revolutionized analog simulation by providing a standardized method for circuit analysis. Over the decades, as semiconductor technology advanced, so did the complexity and capabilities of analog simulation tools, allowing for intricate modeling of multi-domain systems including mixed-signal circuits.
