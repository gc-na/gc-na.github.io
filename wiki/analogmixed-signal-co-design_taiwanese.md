# Analog/Mixed-Signal Co-design (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Analog/Mixed-Signal Co-design

Analog/Mixed-Signal Co-design refers to the integrated design process of analog and digital circuits within a single system. This methodology is crucial for developing Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions, where both analog and digital functionalities must coexist and communicate effectively. The co-design approach enables designers to optimize performance, reduce power consumption, and minimize area while addressing the challenges of signal integrity and noise.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
