# Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification

Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification refers to the process of validating and ensuring the functionality, performance, and reliability of circuits that have both analog and digital components. This verification process is crucial in the design and development of systems such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), System on Chips (SoCs), and other integrated circuits that integrate analog signals with digital signal processing. The goal of Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification is to confirm that the circuit behaves as intended under various conditions and meets the specifications outlined in the design phase.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Analog/Mixed-Signal Verification can be traced back to the increasing complexity of integrated circuits during the late 20th century. Early verification methods primarily focused on digital circuits, leaving analog components often inadequately tested. The advent of sophisticated design tools and methodologies in the 1990s, such as SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), marked a significant shift in the verification landscape.

With advancements in simulation techniques, including Monte Carlo analysis and statistical methods, the verification process became more robust. The introduction of hardware description languages (HDLs), such as VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS, further enhanced the ability to model mixed-signal systems, allowing engineers to simulate complex interactions between analog and digital components.
