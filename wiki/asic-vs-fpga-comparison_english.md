# ASIC vs. FPGA Comparison (English)

## Definition of ASIC vs. FPGA

**Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)** and **Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)** are two distinct types of semiconductor technologies used for different applications in the realm of digital circuit design. An ASIC is a custom-designed chip optimized for a specific application, which results in high performance and energy efficiency. Conversely, an FPGA is a versatile chip that can be programmed and reconfigured after manufacturing, offering flexibility and adaptability for various tasks.
