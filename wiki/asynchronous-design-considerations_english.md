# Asynchronous Design Considerations (English)

## Definition of Asynchronous Design Considerations

Asynchronous Design Considerations refer to the principles and methodologies involved in designing digital circuits that operate without a global clock signal. This design paradigm contrasts with synchronous design, where operations are triggered by clock edges. Asynchronous systems use local handshaking protocols to control data flow and synchronize operations, allowing for potentially lower power consumption, increased speed, and improved robustness against variations in process and temperature.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of asynchronous design dates back to the 1950s, with early implementations in the form of asynchronous circuits being explored by researchers such as J.B. Dennis and H.T. Papalambros. However, the popularity of synchronous design surged with the advent of reliable clocking mechanisms and the increasing complexity of integrated circuits in the 1980s and 1990s.

Recent technological advancements, including the development of high-speed semiconductor materials, improved design automation tools, and better modeling techniques, have rejuvenated interest in asynchronous design. As a result, many researchers are investigating hybrid designs that combine asynchronous and synchronous elements to leverage the strengths of both paradigms.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Handshaking Protocols

Handshaking protocols are crucial in asynchronous designs, allowing devices to communicate and synchronize operations without a global clock. Common protocols include the Request-Acknowledge (RQ-ACK) scheme, where one device requests data transfer and the other acknowledges receipt.

### Delay-Insensitive Circuits

Delay-insensitive circuits are designed to function correctly regardless of variations in signal propagation delays. These circuits utilize completion detection and other techniques to ensure reliable operation in the absence of a global clock.

### Speed and Power Efficiency

Asynchronous designs can offer significant advantages in speed and power efficiency by eliminating the need for clock distribution networks and reducing power consumption associated with clock transitions. This efficiency is particularly beneficial in low-power applications such as mobile devices and embedded systems.
