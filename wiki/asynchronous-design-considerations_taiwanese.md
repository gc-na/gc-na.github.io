# Asynchronous Design Considerations (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Asynchronous Design Considerations

Asynchronous Design Considerations refer to the methodologies and principles applied in the design of digital systems that do not rely on a global clock signal for synchronization. In contrast to synchronous designs, which utilize a timing clock to coordinate operations, asynchronous designs operate based on the completion of events, allowing for more flexible and efficient circuit implementations. This approach is particularly relevant in reducing power consumption, improving performance, and enhancing modularity in complex systems such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of asynchronous design emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the limitations of synchronous circuits. Early asynchronous designs were primarily utilized in low-power applications, but with advancements in VLSI technology, the potential for asynchronous systems expanded significantly. In Taiwan, a rapid growth in semiconductor manufacturing and research has led to a surge in interest in asynchronous designs, particularly for applications in mobile devices, IoT, and high-performance computing.

Key technological advancements include:

- **Self-Timed Circuits:** These circuits leverage completion signals to dictate operations, minimizing idle times and enhancing throughput.
- **Null Convention Logic (NCL):** A notable asynchronous design paradigm that integrates data and control within a single framework, allowing for more efficient data processing.
- **Quasi-Delay Insensitive Circuits:** These designs maintain functionality regardless of variations in gate delays, making them robust against manufacturing inconsistencies.
