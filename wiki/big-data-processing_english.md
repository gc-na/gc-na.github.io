# Big Data Processing (English)

## Definition of Big Data Processing

Big Data Processing refers to the methods and technologies used to collect, store, analyze, and visualize vast volumes of data that are too large, fast, or complex for traditional data processing software. This processing involves not only handling structured data but also unstructured and semi-structured data from diverse sources such as social media, IoT devices, and online transactions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Big Data emerged in the early 2000s as organizations began to recognize the potential value of large datasets generated from various sources. Early efforts focused on improving data storage solutions, leading to the development of distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop, introduced by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella in 2005. This marked a significant advancement in data processing technologies, enabling parallel processing across clusters of computers.

The rise of cloud computing in the 2010s further transformed Big Data Processing, with platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud offering scalable resources for data analysis. Technologies such as Apache Spark, which allows for faster processing of large datasets, gained traction, promoting real-time data analytics.
