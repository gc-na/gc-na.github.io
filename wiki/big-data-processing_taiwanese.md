# Big Data Processing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Big Data Processing

Big Data Processing refers to the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of large and complex datasets that traditional data processing software cannot manage efficiently. These datasets are characterized by the "Three Vs": Volume, Velocity, and Variety. In the context of Taiwanese technological advancements, Big Data Processing is increasingly integral to various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, driving innovation and efficiency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Early Developments

The history of Big Data Processing can be traced back to the 1950s with the advent of mainframe computers. However, the term "Big Data" gained prominence in the early 2000s when the rapid growth of internet usage, mobile devices, and IoT (Internet of Things) led to an explosion of data generation.

### Technological Milestones

- **Hadoop Ecosystem (2005)**: The introduction of Apache Hadoop marked a significant milestone in Big Data Processing. Its distributed storage and processing capabilities enabled organizations to handle massive datasets more efficiently.
- **NoSQL Databases (2009)**: The rise of NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Cassandra, provided flexible schema designs, allowing organizations to store unstructured data more effectively.
- **Cloud Computing (2010s)**: The emergence of cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure revolutionized data storage and processing, enabling scalable solutions that are cost-effective for Taiwanese enterprises.
