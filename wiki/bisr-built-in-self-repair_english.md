# BISR (Built-In Self-Repair) (English)

## Definition of BISR

Built-In Self-Repair (BISR) refers to a set of techniques integrated into semiconductor devices that enable them to detect, isolate, and correct faults autonomously during operation. This self-repair capability is critical for enhancing the reliability and longevity of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in environments susceptible to defects and failures. BISR systems utilize a combination of hardware and software mechanisms to ensure that defective components can be either repaired or replaced without external intervention, thereby improving the yield and performance of semiconductor devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Built-In Self-Repair emerged alongside advancements in semiconductor technology during the late 20th century. Early efforts focused on error correction codes and redundancy techniques in memory devices, particularly in SRAM (Static Random-Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory). As integrated circuits grew more complex with the introduction of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technologies, the need for robust self-repair mechanisms became evident.

In the 1990s, the introduction of BISR techniques was primarily motivated by the increasing costs associated with testing and manufacturing semiconductor chips. The move towards smaller technology nodes, particularly in CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) processes, necessitated more sophisticated methods for handling defects. Over the years, BISR has evolved significantly, incorporating advanced algorithms, machine learning, and adaptive techniques to enhance performance.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Comparison: BISR vs. BIST (Built-In Self-Test)

While BISR focuses on the repair of defects in integrated circuits, Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is oriented towards testing and diagnosing faults. 

- **BISR**: Aims to identify and correct faults autonomously, thereby enhancing reliability and reducing maintenance costs.
- **BIST**: Primarily concerned with testing the functionality of a circuit before deployment, often using predefined test patterns.

Both technologies are complementary, as effective BIST can improve the efficiency of BISR by providing accurate fault information.

### Key Engineering Fundamentals

- **Redundancy**: BISR often employs redundancy strategies where additional components are included to replace faulty ones.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability of a system to continue operating correctly in the presence of faults is a fundamental aspect of BISR.
- **Error Correction Codes (ECC)**: These are algorithms used to detect and correct errors in data storage and transmission, playing a crucial role in BISR systems.

## Latest Trends in BISR

Recent advancements in BISR technology are characterized by several key trends:

- **Integration with AI and Machine Learning**: The incorporation of AI techniques enhances the predictive capabilities of BISR systems, enabling them to adapt to fault patterns in real-time.
- **Multi-Scale Repair Techniques**: Emerging BISR systems are capable of addressing faults at different levels, including device, circuit, and system levels, to improve overall performance.
- **Focus on Energy Efficiency**: As power consumption becomes a critical factor in semiconductor design, BISR solutions are being developed to minimize energy usage during self-repair processes.

## Major Applications of BISR

BISR technology finds applications across various sectors, including:

- **Memory Devices**: BISR is extensively used in SRAM and DRAM to enhance yield and reliability.
