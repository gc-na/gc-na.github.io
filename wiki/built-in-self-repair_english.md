# Built-In Self-Repair (English)

## Definition
Built-In Self-Repair (BISR) refers to a set of design techniques integrated into semiconductor devices, particularly in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), that enable these devices to autonomously identify and rectify faults during operation. BISR enhances system reliability and longevity by allowing for the detection and reconfiguration of defective components without the need for external intervention.

## Historical Background
The concept of self-repair in electronic systems emerged during the late 20th century as a response to the increasing complexity of integrated circuits, which led to higher rates of defects and failures. Early implementations were primarily focused on redundancy techniques, wherein duplicate components would take over in case of failure. However, as technology advanced, particularly with the advent of nanometer-scale manufacturing processes, more sophisticated mechanisms were developed.

### Technological Advancements
The evolution of BISR has been significantly influenced by advancements in fault tolerance methodologies and the proliferation of design for testability (DFT) techniques. The integration of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in recent years has further enhanced BISR's capabilities, allowing for adaptive self-repair mechanisms that can learn from previous faults and optimize repair strategies.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
### Fault Tolerance Techniques
BISR is often compared to traditional fault tolerance mechanisms, such as:
- **Redundancy**: Involves duplicating critical components to ensure that if one fails, another can take over. This technique is less efficient in terms of area and power consumption compared to BISR.
- **Error Detection and Correction (EDAC)**: Focuses on identifying and correcting errors in data transmission and storage, but does not address hardware component failures directly.

### Testability and Diagnostics
BISR employs various DFT techniques to enhance the testability of integrated circuits. These techniques include:
- **Scan Chains**: Allow for the testing of individual flip-flops in a digital circuit.
- **Built-In Self-Test (BIST)**: Facilitates self-testing of the device, which complements BISR by identifying defects that need repair.

## Latest Trends
Recent trends in BISR technology include:
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizing ML algorithms for more efficient fault classification and adaptive repair strategies.
- **3D Integration**: As semiconductor technology moves toward three-dimensional structures, BISR is evolving to handle complexities associated with vertical integration.
- **IoT Applications**: With the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, BISR is being increasingly applied to improve the reliability of low-cost, resource-constrained devices.

## Major Applications
BISR technology is utilized across various industries, including:
- **Consumer Electronics**: Ensures the reliability of smartphones, tablets, and wearable devices.
- **Automotive Systems**: Increases the safety and reliability of critical automotive electronics, such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
- **Aerospace and Defense**: Provides fault tolerance for complex systems where failure can have catastrophic consequences.
- **Medical Devices**: Enhances the reliability of life-critical equipment.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions
Current research is exploring several exciting avenues in BISR:
- **Adaptive Self-Repair Mechanisms**: Developing systems that not only repair but also predict potential failures based on historical data.
- **Energy-Efficient BISR**: Focusing on minimizing the power overhead associated with self-repair processes.
- **Integration with Quantum Computing**: Investigating how BISR can be adapted for emerging quantum technologies, which have unique fault tolerance challenges.

### A vs B: Built-In Self-Repair vs. Built-In Self-Test
- **Built-In Self-Repair (BISR)** focuses on correcting faults within the hardware components, ensuring continued operation.
