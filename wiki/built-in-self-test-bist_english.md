# Built-in Self-Test (BIST) (English)

## Definition of Built-in Self-Test (BIST)

Built-in Self-Test (BIST) is a design technique that allows a system to test itself through integrated testing hardware and algorithms implemented within the system itself. BIST is primarily used in semiconductor devices, particularly Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, to ensure functionality, reliability, and performance without external testing equipment. By embedding self-testing capabilities, BIST enhances fault detection, simplifies diagnostics, and reduces the overall cost and time associated with testing.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Built-in Self-Test was introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s as integrated circuits began to proliferate in various applications. Early implementations of BIST focused on memory testing, primarily due to the increasing complexity and density of memory devices. The introduction of BIST techniques allowed manufacturers to perform diagnostic tests without relying on external testers, which were often expensive and time-consuming.

As semiconductor technology advanced, so did BIST methodologies. The evolution of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems necessitated more sophisticated testing mechanisms. The 1990s saw the development of various BIST architectures that incorporated algorithms for test pattern generation and response analysis. With the advent of advanced manufacturing processes, such as 90nm and below, the importance of BIST has grown significantly, especially with the need for high fault coverage and the reduction of test time.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### Advanced Process Nodes

Modern semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as 5nm technology, have heightened the relevance of BIST. At these scales, the probability of defects increases, and the complexity of testing methods necessitates the integration of efficient BIST solutions. BIST can mitigate issues related to process variations, thereby ensuring that chips can meet performance specifications.

### Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA FET)

The emergence of GAA FET technology presents new opportunities and challenges for BIST. This novel transistor architecture promises improved electrostatic control and reduced leakage current, which is critical for low-power applications. BIST methodologies need to evolve to accommodate the unique characteristics of GAA FETs, ensuring comprehensive testing and validation of these advanced devices.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)

EUV lithography has revolutionized the semiconductor manufacturing landscape by enabling the production of smaller features with higher precision. As EUV technology becomes more mainstream, the integration of BIST strategies is essential to ensure that the complex circuitry fabricated using EUV can be effectively tested for defects and performance issues.

## Major Applications

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

In the realm of AI, BIST plays a critical role in validating the functionality and reliability of AI accelerators and neural network processors. The ability to perform self-tests ensures that these components can handle the intensive computations required for AI applications without compromising performance.

### Networking

BIST techniques are increasingly utilized in networking hardware, including switches and routers. As data centers demand higher throughput and lower latency, BIST allows for real-time diagnostics and maintenance, ensuring network reliability and uptime.

### Computing

In general computing, BIST is vital for the testing of CPUs, GPUs, and memory units. As these components become more complex, the need for efficient testing methodologies that can be embedded within the chips themselves becomes paramount.

### Automotive

The automotive industry has embraced BIST as vehicles become more reliant on electronic systems, including advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. BIST ensures that safety-critical components can be continuously monitored and tested for faults throughout their operational life.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions
