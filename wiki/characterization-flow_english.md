# Characterization Flow (English)

## Definition of Characterization Flow

Characterization Flow refers to the systematic process used in semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems to assess the performance, reliability, and functional characteristics of integrated circuits (ICs) and semiconductor devices. This flow encompasses various testing methodologies, data collection techniques, and analysis tools that enable engineers to evaluate the physical and electrical properties of devices throughout their life cycle, from design to fabrication and post-manufacturing.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of semiconductor technology has necessitated increasingly sophisticated characterization techniques. In the early years of semiconductor development, characterization involved basic electrical testing and visual inspections. However, as the complexity of devices increased, so did the demand for more refined characterization methods.

The introduction of integrated circuits in the 1960s marked a significant advancement, leading to the development of automated test equipment (ATE) in the 1970s. The 1980s and 1990s saw the advent of more advanced techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), which allowed for detailed analysis at the nanoscale. Today, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence into characterization processes is emerging as a revolutionary trend.
