# Characterization Flow (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Characterization Flow

Characterization Flow refers to a systematic methodology used in the semiconductor industry to evaluate and optimize the performance of integrated circuits (ICs) and systems-on-chip (SoCs). This process involves a series of tests and measurements that assess various electrical, thermal, and physical parameters of semiconductor devices to ensure they meet design specifications and performance criteria. The flow encompasses multiple stages, including device fabrication, electrical characterization, reliability testing, and data analysis.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Characterization Flow has evolved significantly since the inception of semiconductor technology in the mid-20th century. In the early days, characterization was primarily focused on basic electrical properties, such as current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. However, with the advent of advanced technologies such as CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor), characterization techniques have become more sophisticated and comprehensive.

The 1990s witnessed the introduction of automated test equipment (ATE) that enhanced the speed and accuracy of characterization processes. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in recent years has opened new avenues for predictive analytics, enabling engineers to identify potential design flaws before fabrication.
