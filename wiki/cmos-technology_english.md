#CMOS Technology (English)

## Definition of CMOS Technology

Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology refers to a widely adopted semiconductor fabrication process used to create integrated circuits (ICs). This technology relies on the complementary properties of p-type (positive) and n-type (negative) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). The fundamental characteristic of CMOS is its ability to consume very low static power, making it the backbone of modern digital electronics, including microprocessors, memory chips, and image sensors.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The inception of CMOS technology dates back to the 1960s. The first CMOS transistor was developed in 1963 by Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor. It was not until the 1980s that CMOS gained prominence as a dominant technology for digital logic circuits, primarily due to its low power consumption and scalability. The introduction of the 0.5-micron technology node in the 1990s marked a significant milestone, enabling the integration of more transistors on a chip.

The 21st century has witnessed rapid advancements in CMOS technology, characterized by the continuous miniaturization of transistors. The introduction of FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) technology around 2011 allowed for better control over short-channel effects, enhancing performance and power efficiency. As of 2023, the industry has moved towards the 5nm technology node, showcasing the ability to place billions of transistors in a compact area, which is critical for the performance demands of contemporary applications.
