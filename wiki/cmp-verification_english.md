# CMP Verification (English)

## Definition of CMP Verification

Chemical Mechanical Planarization (CMP) Verification is a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing that assesses the effectiveness of the CMP process used to achieve a uniform surface topography on semiconductor wafers. This verification ensures that the desired material removal rates are met, and that the surface quality is sufficient for subsequent fabrication steps. In essence, CMP Verification serves as a quality control mechanism, verifying that the planarization process results in the required specifications for flatness, surface roughness, and other critical parameters.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of CMP was first introduced in the late 1970s as a method to improve the fabrication of integrated circuits (ICs). Initially, CMP was utilized for polishing oxide layers, but its application has since expanded to include a variety of materials such as copper, silicon, and low-k dielectrics. The evolution of CMP technology has been driven by the need for higher device densities and better performance in integrated circuits as feature sizes have shrunk to nanoscale dimensions.

Recent advancements in CMP Verification technologies have focused on enhancing measurement techniques and algorithms to better predict and control the outcomes of the CMP process. The integration of advanced metrology tools and machine learning algorithms has enabled more precise verification processes, which are essential for maintaining high yields in semiconductor manufacturing.
