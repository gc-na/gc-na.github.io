# Co-optimization Algorithms (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Co-optimization Algorithms

Co-optimization algorithms refer to a class of computational methods that simultaneously optimize multiple interdependent design parameters within a system. These algorithms are particularly prevalent in the fields of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, where they aim to enhance performance metrics such as power consumption, area, and speed. By addressing the intricate relationships between various design components, co-optimization ensures that the overall system achieves optimal performance rather than merely optimizing individual elements in isolation.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Co-optimization algorithms have evolved alongside advancements in semiconductor technology and VLSI design methodologies. The genesis of these algorithms can be traced back to the early 1990s when the rapid increase in chip complexity necessitated more holistic approaches to design. Initial efforts primarily focused on physical design optimization, but over the years, the scope expanded to include aspects such as architecture, circuit design, and software.

The advent of methods such as Design Space Exploration (DSE) and Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) has further propelled the development of co-optimization algorithms. These methods allowed designers to evaluate numerous design configurations and trade-offs, leading to more efficient and powerful chips.
