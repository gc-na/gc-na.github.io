# Co-simulation (Taiwanese)

Co-simulation is an essential methodology in the field of semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, enabling the concurrent simulation of multiple subsystems or components to analyze their interactions comprehensively. This article delves into the definition, historical background, technological advancements, related technologies, major applications, current research trends, and future directions concerning co-simulation.

## Definition of Co-simulation

Co-simulation refers to the simultaneous simulation of multiple models or systems to analyze the interactions between them in a comprehensive and synchronized manner. This technique is particularly significant in complex system designs such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), where various components exhibit interdependencies that must be evaluated in real-time. Co-simulation integrates different simulation environments, allowing engineers to leverage specific tools optimized for different parts of the design, thus enhancing accuracy and efficiency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Co-simulation has evolved significantly since the early days of electronic design automation (EDA) in the 1980s. Initially, simulation tools focused on isolated components, resulting in a lack of awareness regarding the holistic behavior of integrated systems. The advent of more sophisticated modeling techniques, such as SystemC and VHDL-AMS, allowed for the integration of digital and analog simulations.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, advancements in computing power and algorithm efficiency paved the way for more complex co-simulation environments. The rise of multi-core processors and parallel computing enabled engineers to conduct real-time simulations, further enhancing the feasibility of co-simulation in VLSI design.
