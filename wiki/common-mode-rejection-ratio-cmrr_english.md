# Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) (English)

## Definition of Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)

The Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) is a key parameter used primarily in operational amplifiers and differential amplifiers to quantify the ability of a circuit to reject common-mode signalsâ€”signals that are present simultaneously and in-phase on both the positive and negative inputs. Mathematically, CMRR is defined as the ratio of the differential gain (Ad) to the common-mode gain (Ac):

\[
\text{CMRR} = 20 \times \log_{10} \left( \frac{A_d}{A_c} \right) \, \text{dB}
\]

A higher CMRR value indicates better performance in rejecting unwanted common-mode signals, making it a crucial factor in the design and analysis of analog circuits, especially in environments with high levels of electromagnetic interference.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of CMRR emerged alongside the development of operational amplifiers in the mid-20th century, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s when the demand for precision analog circuitry increased significantly. Early operational amplifiers exhibited limited CMRR, typically around 60 dB, which spurred research into improving this characteristic. 

Technological advancements, including the advent of integrated circuits, led to the development of high-performance operational amplifiers with CMRR values exceeding 100 dB. This improvement is attributed to advancements in semiconductor technology, feedback design techniques, and the use of matched transistor pairs.

## Engineering Fundamentals and Related Technologies

### Differential Amplifiers

Differential amplifiers are at the heart of CMRR applications. They amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting any signals that are common to both. Understanding the design and operation of differential amplifiers is essential for engineers looking to optimize CMRR in their circuits.

### Feedback Mechanisms

Negative feedback is a fundamental principle in operational amplifier design that plays a significant role in improving CMRR. By feeding a portion of the output back to the inverting input, the circuit stabilizes and reduces the effect of common-mode signals.

### Integrated Circuit Design

Modern VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology allows the integration of multiple operational amplifiers on a single chip, enabling the design of compact and efficient systems with high CMRR. Advances in material science, such as the use of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, have further enhanced the performance of integrated amplifiers.

## Latest Trends in CMRR

Recent trends in CMRR research focus on the development of amplifiers with ultra-high CMRR values, particularly in applications requiring high precision, such as biomedical instrumentation and telecommunications. Additionally, the use of advanced materials and fabrication techniques, including graphene and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), is being explored to enhance the performance of analog circuits.
