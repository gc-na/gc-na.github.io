# Connectivity Checking (Taiwanese)

Connectivity Checking is a crucial aspect of semiconductor design and verification processes, particularly in the realm of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It involves ensuring that the various components of a circuit are correctly connected and function as intended. This article explores the definition, historical background, related technologies, current trends, and future directions of Connectivity Checking, particularly within the context of Taiwanese semiconductor technology.

## Definition of Connectivity Checking

Connectivity Checking refers to the verification process that ensures electrical connections between different components of a circuit are properly established according to the design specifications. This process is vital in identifying potential faults such as shorts, opens, or incorrect connections that may lead to malfunction in integrated circuits (ICs). The verification can be performed at various stages of design, including during schematic capture, layout verification, and post-layout simulations.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of Connectivity Checking can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuit design in the 1960s. As semiconductor technology evolved, so did the complexity of designs, necessitating more sophisticated verification methods. Initially, manual checks were common, but as designs grew in complexity, automated tools were developed.

By the 1980s, the introduction of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools revolutionized the Connectivity Checking process. These tools enabled designers to automate the verification process, significantly reducing the time and effort required. Taiwanese semiconductor companies, such as TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), have been at the forefront of adopting advanced EDA tools to enhance their design verification processes.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### 1. Electronic Design Automation (EDA)

EDA tools encompass a range of software used for designing electronic systems, including Connectivity Checking. These tools facilitate the creation, analysis, and optimization of circuit designs. Common EDA tools for Connectivity Checking include:
