# Constrained Equivalence Verification (English)

Constrained Equivalence Verification (CEV) is a formal verification technique used in the design and validation of digital circuits, particularly in the realm of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This methodology focuses on ensuring that two representations of a design, typically a reference (or golden) model and a modified version, produce equivalent outputs under a specified set of input constraints.

## Definition of Constrained Equivalence Verification

Constrained Equivalence Verification is defined as the process of verifying that two representations of a digital design are functionally equivalent for a given set of input constraints. Mathematically, CEV can be expressed as follows: Given two circuits \(C_1\) and \(C_2\), and a set of input constraints \(I\), CEV determines whether \(C_1(x) = C_2(x)\) holds true for all \(x \in I\). This technique is particularly beneficial in scenarios where exhaustive verification is computationally prohibitive, allowing for focused analysis under practical operating conditions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Constrained Equivalence Verification emerged in the late 1990s as the complexity of digital designs increased, necessitating more efficient verification methods. Traditional equivalence checking methods, which aimed to verify all possible input combinations, faced scalability issues. As a response, researchers developed CEV techniques that leverage constraints to limit the verification space, thereby improving performance.
