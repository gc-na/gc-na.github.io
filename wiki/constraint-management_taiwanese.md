# Constraint Management (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Constraint Management

Constraint Management refers to the systematic approach employed in engineering and project management to identify, analyze, and mitigate constraints or limitations that impact the performance, cost, and schedule of a project. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, constraint management involves optimizing the design and manufacturing processes of integrated circuits (ICs) to ensure that specifications are met while adhering to time and resource limitations.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of constraint management has evolved significantly since its inception in project management theories during the 20th century. In semiconductor technology, the need for constraint management emerged with the increasing complexity and miniaturization of integrated circuits. The advent of Moore's Law in the 1960s catalyzed the rapid development of VLSI systems, necessitating advanced methodologies to handle design constraints such as power consumption, timing, area, and manufacturability.

Technological advancements in software tools, such as Electronic Design Automation (EDA), have played a critical role in constraint management. EDA tools provide designers with capabilities to simulate, verify, and optimize designs against various constraints, allowing for a more efficient design process. Furthermore, methodologies like Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and Design for Testability (DFT) have become integral in managing constraints throughout the product lifecycle.
