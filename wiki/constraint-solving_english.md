# Constraint Solving (English)

## Definition of Constraint Solving

Constraint solving is a computational process that involves the identification and resolution of constraints within mathematical models. In a more formal sense, it can be defined as the process of finding solutions to problems defined by constraints, where a constraint is a condition or requirement that must be met for a solution to be valid. This process is fundamental to various fields, including artificial intelligence, operations research, and computer-aided design, particularly in the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) emerged in the early 1970s as researchers sought to formalize and solve problems that could be described using constraints. Early algorithms focused on simple backtracking methods, but advancements in heuristic techniques and optimization algorithms, such as local search and constraint propagation, have significantly enhanced the efficiency and applicability of constraint solving.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the development of constraint programming (CP) emerged as a distinct paradigm, allowing for more complex and diverse applications. The introduction of hybrid approaches, combining CP with other methodologies like integer programming and SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem), has further broadened the scope and effectiveness of constraint solving techniques.

### Constraint Programming vs. Operations Research

Constraint programming (CP) is often compared to operations research (OR) due to their overlapping goals of optimal decision-making and resource allocation. 

- **Constraint Programming (CP):** Focuses on defining problems in terms of variables and constraints, allowing for expressive and flexible modeling. Solvers can explore the search space efficiently using various strategies, including constraint propagation and search heuristics.
  
- **Operations Research (OR):** Typically involves mathematical optimization techniques where the objective function is explicitly defined, and the goal is to optimize this function subject to constraints. OR techniques often utilize linear programming, integer programming, and network flows.

Both methodologies can be complementary, with CP providing a more flexible modeling framework, while OR excels in optimization scenarios with well-defined objectives.
