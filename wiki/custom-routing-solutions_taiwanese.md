# Custom Routing Solutions (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Custom Routing Solutions

Custom Routing Solutions refer to specialized methodologies and software tools designed for the efficient routing of interconnections in integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). These solutions optimize the placement and connection of components on a silicon die, aiming to minimize signal delay, reduce power consumption, and enhance overall performance. Custom routing involves tailored algorithms that account for specific design rules and performance requirements, distinguishing it from standard routing techniques.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Custom Routing Solutions can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor design when engineers manually laid out circuit designs. As integrated circuits grew in complexity during the 1980s and 1990s, the need for automated design tools became paramount. Significant advancements in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software led to the development of sophisticated routing algorithms capable of handling complex geometries and design constraints.

In the 21st century, the proliferation of VLSI technology and the demand for high-performance computing have accelerated the evolution of custom routing techniques. Innovations such as machine learning and artificial intelligence have begun to play a role in optimizing routing solutions, enabling designs that were previously unattainable.
