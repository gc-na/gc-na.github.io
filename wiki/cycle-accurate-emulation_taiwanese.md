# Cycle-Accurate Emulation (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Cycle-Accurate Emulation

Cycle-Accurate Emulation (CAE) refers to a simulation technique used in the design and verification of digital systems, particularly in the context of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. It provides a precise representation of the operation of a hardware design at the clock cycle level, enabling engineers to test and validate functionality, performance, and timing before fabrication. Unlike high-level simulation, CAE ensures that every clock cycle's behavior is faithfully reproduced, allowing for comprehensive debugging and validation of complex interactions within the system.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Cycle-Accurate Emulation can be traced back to the increasing complexity of semiconductor designs in the late 20th century. With the advent of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technologies, traditional simulation methods became inadequate for handling the intricate designs of modern chips. Early emulators were predominantly hardware-based, employing dedicated systems to mimic the behavior of target hardware. 

In the 2000s, advancements in FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) technology enabled the development of more flexible and powerful emulation platforms, allowing designers to implement CAE more efficiently. As the demand for faster design cycles and higher accuracy increased, CAE has become an essential tool in the semiconductor industry.
