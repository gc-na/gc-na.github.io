# Defect Modeling (English)

## Definition of Defect Modeling

Defect modeling refers to the systematic analysis and representation of defects in semiconductor devices and integrated circuits (ICs) during the design, fabrication, and testing phases. It encompasses the identification, characterization, and quantification of defects that can impact the performance, reliability, and yield of semiconductor products. Defect modeling plays a critical role in ensuring that integrated circuits function correctly under various operational conditions and meet reliability standards.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of defect modeling emerged alongside advancements in semiconductor technology during the mid-20th century. Early defect models primarily focused on understanding the physical phenomena associated with material imperfections and their implications on device performance. With the introduction of microelectronics and VLSI systems in the 1970s, the complexity of defect modeling increased as the number of transistors on a chip grew exponentially.

Technological advancements, including the development of sophisticated simulation tools and characterization techniques, have significantly enhanced defect modeling capabilities. The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in recent years has further accelerated the ability to predict and mitigate defects in semiconductor manufacturing processes.
