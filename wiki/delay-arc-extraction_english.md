# Delay Arc Extraction (English)

## Definition
Delay Arc Extraction refers to the process of identifying and quantifying the delays associated with signal propagation in VLSI circuits, particularly within the context of timing analysis. This process involves extracting delay information from circuit descriptions, which can be used for static timing analysis, dynamic simulation, and optimization of design parameters to ensure that the circuit meets its timing requirements.

## Historical Background
The concept of delay arc extraction has evolved significantly since the advent of VLSI technology in the late 20th century. Initial approaches focused primarily on simplistic models of propagation delay, often neglecting the complexities introduced by parasitic capacitance and resistance. However, as the integration density of circuits increased, the need for more accurate delay models became evident.

Technological advancements in simulation tools and methodologies, such as the introduction of the SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulator in the 1970s, laid the groundwork for sophisticated delay extraction techniques. By the 1990s, the emergence of static timing analysis tools allowed engineers to evaluate circuit performance without the need for exhaustive simulation, leading to the widespread adoption of delay arc extraction in design flows.

## Related Technologies

### Static Timing Analysis (STA)
STA is a methodology used to verify that a circuit meets its timing constraints. Delay arc extraction plays a crucial role in STA by providing the necessary delay metrics to evaluate signal paths. These metrics help identify critical paths in the circuit that may affect overall performance.

### Dynamic Timing Analysis
Unlike STA, dynamic timing analysis involves simulating the circuit under various operating conditions to assess timing behavior. Delay arc extraction techniques can support dynamic analysis by offering accurate delay parameters that reflect real-world conditions.

### Parasitic Extraction
Parasitic extraction deals with the identification of parasitic elements that can influence the performance of VLSI circuits. Delay arc extraction often incorporates parasitic data to ensure that the calculated delays reflect the actual signal integrity within the circuit.
