# Delay Modeling (Taiwanese)

## Formal Definition of Delay Modeling

Delay modeling in the context of semiconductor technology refers to the process of predicting and analyzing the time it takes for signals to propagate through a circuit or system. This modeling is crucial in the design of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), ensuring that the circuits operate within the required timing constraints. Delay modeling encompasses various aspects, including combinational and sequential delays, setup and hold times, and the impact of process variations on signal timing.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of delay modeling can be traced back to the early days of digital electronics, where basic timing analysis was primarily performed using hand calculations. As technology advanced, especially with the advent of VLSI systems in the 1970s, the complexity of circuits increased, necessitating more sophisticated modeling techniques. The introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the 1980s marked a significant turning point, enabling engineers to simulate and analyze timing in a more efficient manner.

In recent years, advancements in fabrication technologies, such as FinFET and SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator), have introduced new challenges in delay modeling. As device dimensions shrink and the number of transistors per chip increases, the need for accurate delay models has become paramount to ensure optimal performance.

### Delay Types

1. **Combinational Delay**: This refers to the delay encountered in circuits where the output solely depends on the current inputs, such as in logic gates.
  
2. **Sequential Delay**: This type of delay is associated with circuits where the output depends on both current inputs and previous states, commonly found in flip-flops and registers.

### Key Concepts

- **Setup Time**: The minimum time before the clock edge that the input to a flip-flop must be stable.
- **Hold Time**: The minimum time after the clock edge that the input must remain stable.
- **Propagation Delay**: The time taken for a signal to travel from the input to the output of a logic gate.

### Tools and Techniques

Modern delay modeling employs various tools and methodologies, including:

- **Static Timing Analysis (STA)**: A method used to validate the timing performance of a circuit without requiring simulation.
- **Dynamic Timing Analysis**: Involves simulating the circuit to observe timing behavior under various operating conditions.

## Latest Trends in Delay Modeling

With the rapid advancements in semiconductor technology, several trends are shaping delay modeling:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: The use of machine learning algorithms to improve delay prediction accuracy by analyzing large datasets of circuit performance.
