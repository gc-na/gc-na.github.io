# Design for Debug (English)

## Definition of Design for Debug

Design for Debug (DfD) is a systematic approach integrated into the design and development process of electronic systems, particularly in semiconductor technology and Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It encompasses a range of methodologies and tools aimed at enhancing the debug capabilities of a system, facilitating the identification and resolution of defects or performance issues during the design, manufacturing, and testing phases. DfD ensures that the final product is not only functional but also easy to diagnose and repair, thereby improving overall reliability and reducing time-to-market.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Design for Debug emerged alongside the evolution of semiconductor technology. In the early days of integrated circuit design, the
