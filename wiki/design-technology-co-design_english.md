# Design-Technology Co-design (English)

## Definition

Design-Technology Co-design (DTC) refers to the integrated approach of designing hardware and software systems while simultaneously considering the underlying technology constraints and capabilities. This methodology aims to optimize both the design process and the final product by fostering collaboration between design engineers and technology specialists. DTC emphasizes the importance of considering the physical and technological limitations of semiconductor technologies during the design phase, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and manufacturability of integrated circuits (ICs) and systems-on-chip (SoCs).

## Historical Background

The concept of co-design emerged in the late 20th century with the advent of complex digital systems and the need for efficient design techniques. Initially, the focus was on Hardware-Software Co-design, where designers sought to create a seamless interface between hardware components and software applications. As semiconductor technology advanced, particularly with the introduction of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the need for a more holistic approach that included technology considerations led to the formalization of Design-Technology Co-design.

Technological advancements such as deep submicron fabrication processes, multi-core architectures, and high-level synthesis tools have significantly influenced the evolution of DTC. These developments necessitated new design methodologies that could efficiently manage power, performance, and area (PPA) trade-offs, ultimately driving the need for DTC.
