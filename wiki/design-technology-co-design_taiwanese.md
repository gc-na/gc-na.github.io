# Design-Technology Co-design (Taiwanese)

## Formal Definition

Design-Technology Co-design (DTC) is an integrated approach that combines the design and technology aspects of semiconductor systems and circuits to optimize performance, power consumption, and cost-effectiveness. In the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, DTC emphasizes simultaneous consideration of design specifications and technological capabilities during the development process. This methodology aims to align the design requirements with the underlying technology constraints, thereby enabling more efficient and effective semiconductor solutions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Design-Technology Co-design emerged in the late 20th century as semiconductor technologies advanced rapidly, particularly with the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chip (SoC) designs. The increasing complexity of integrated circuits necessitated a more collaborative approach between design engineers and technology developers. 

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry has seen significant growth and technological advancements since the 1980s. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a pivotal moment, as it became the world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry. This model allowed for the rapid evolution of DTC practices, as design teams began to work closely with foundries to optimize chip designs for specific manufacturing processes.
