# Detailed Placement (Taiwanese)

## Formal Definition of Detailed Placement

Detailed Placement is a critical phase in the physical design process of integrated circuits (ICs), primarily focusing on the precise localization of standard cells or macros within a given area of a semiconductor chip. This procedure ensures that the components are positioned optimally to minimize area, power consumption, and signal delay while adhering to the manufacturing process constraints. Detailed Placement follows the global placement stage, where cells are initially positioned based on rough estimates, and it incorporates various algorithms to refine these positions to meet specific design criteria.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Detailed Placement can be traced back to the early days of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology, where the increasing complexity of chips necessitated more sophisticated methods for placing circuit elements. The introduction of software tools in the 1980s, such as those developed by Synopsys and Cadence, marked a significant advancement in the automation of the placement process. Over the years, various algorithms, including simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and quadratic programming, have been developed to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of Detailed Placement.

With advancements in semiconductor technology, including the transition from planar to FinFET transistors and the emergence of 3D ICs, Detailed Placement has evolved to address new challenges such as increased density, heterogeneous integration, and thermal management.

### Placement Algorithms

Detailed Placement utilizes various algorithms to optimize the positioning of components on a chip. Key algorithms include:

- **Simulated Annealing**: This probabilistic technique models the annealing process in metallurgy, allowing for exploration of the placement space and finding better configurations over time.
- **Quadratic Placement**: This algorithm formulates the placement problem as a quadratic optimization problem, minimizing the overall wire length and congestion.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Simple yet effective, these algorithms iteratively place components based on local optimization, though they may not always yield globally optimal solutions.

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

An essential aspect of Detailed Placement is ensuring that the layout complies with design rules specified by the foundry. DRC tools verify that the layout adheres to the geometrical and electrical constraints required for manufacturability.

### Timing Analysis

Detailed Placement is closely linked to timing analysis, which assesses the performance of the circuit in terms of signal propagation delay. Ensuring that the placement minimizes timing violations is crucial for high-performance designs.
