# Detailed Routing (English)

## Definition of Detailed Routing

Detailed routing is a crucial phase in the physical design process of semiconductor devices, particularly in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). It involves the precise placement of interconnecting wires among various components on a semiconductor chip, ensuring that the electrical connections adhere to specific design rules and constraints. Detailed routing follows the earlier stages of design, such as floorplanning and placement, and aims to optimize the routing resources while minimizing issues like signal delay, crosstalk, and power consumption.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of detailed routing can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuit design in the 1960s when engineers manually laid out connections on silicon wafers. As technology advanced, the complexity of circuits increased, necessitating the development of automated tools. The introduction of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software in the 1980s revolutionized the process, allowing for faster and more reliable routing solutions. 

Over the years, advancements in algorithms, such as the use of graph theory and optimization techniques, have significantly improved detailed routing capabilities. The introduction of multi-layered routing and techniques like via minimization and layer assignment have further enhanced routing efficiency and effectiveness.
