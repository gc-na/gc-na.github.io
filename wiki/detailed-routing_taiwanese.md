# Detailed Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Detailed Routing

Detailed Routing is a critical phase in the physical design process of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It involves the precise placement of interconnecting wires and vias within a semiconductor device layout to establish electrical connections between various components, such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors. The primary goal of detailed routing is to optimize the layout for performance metrics such as area, timing, power consumption, and manufacturability while adhering to design rules set by the fabrication process.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Detailed Routing has evolved significantly over the last few decades, driven by the rapid advancements in semiconductor technology. In the early days of integrated circuits, routing was largely manual and based on trial and error. As the complexity of chips increased, the need for automated routing tools became apparent. The introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the 1980s marked a turning point, enabling engineers to automate the routing process and optimize designs more efficiently.

The development of sophisticated algorithms, such as maze routing and Steiner tree algorithms, has further enhanced the capabilities of routing tools. These algorithms allow for the efficient placement of wires while minimizing the overall circuit area and maintaining signal integrity. In recent years, advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have begun to influence detailed routing, providing new methods for optimization and predictive modeling.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Routing vs. Placement

While routing focuses on the interconnections between components, placement involves the spatial arrangement of these components on the silicon die. Both processes are integral to VLSI design, and their effectiveness directly impacts the overall performance of the chip. 

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

Design Rule Checking is a crucial step in the detailed routing process that ensures the layout adheres to the geometric and electrical constraints imposed by the manufacturing process. DRC tools verify that the spacing and widths of the routed wires meet the specifications necessary for reliable fabrication.

### Global vs. Detailed Routing

Global routing provides a high-level overview of the interconnections needed between various blocks of the circuit, while detailed routing focuses on the precise paths that wires will take. Global routing sets the stage for detailed routing by defining potential routes and congestion areas, allowing for more efficient and effective detailed routing.

## Latest Trends

The field of detailed routing is witnessing several notable trends:

1. **Integration with Machine Learning**: The use of machine learning algorithms is becoming increasingly common in routing tools, facilitating better decision-making and optimization based on historical data.

2. **Advanced Node Technologies**: As semiconductor technology progresses toward smaller nodes (e.g., 7nm, 5nm, and beyond), the challenges of detailed routing become more complex due to increased density and reduced feature sizes.

3. **3D IC Design**: The emergence of 3D integrated circuits has introduced new routing challenges, as connections must be established not just in the x and y dimensions but also vertically across layers.

4. **Power and Thermal Management**: With rising power consumption and thermal issues in modern chips, routing strategies are increasingly focused on minimizing power usage and managing heat dissipation.

## Major Applications

Detailed routing is employed in various applications across multiple industries:

- **Consumer Electronics**: Smartphones, tablets, and wearables rely on detailed routing to ensure high performance and compact designs.
