# Device Modeling in DTCO (Korean)

## 정의
Device Modeling in Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) refers to the comprehensive approach used to create accurate models of semiconductor devices that optimize their design and manufacturing processes. This methodology integrates device physics, circuit design, and fabrication technologies to ensure that the performance of integrated circuits meets the stringent requirements of modern applications.

## 역사적 배경 및 기술 발전
DTCO emerged in response to the challenges posed by Moore's Law and the continual miniaturization of semiconductor devices. As transistors scaled down to nanometer dimensions, traditional modeling techniques became inadequate to predict device behavior accurately. In the early 2000s, researchers began to integrate process and design considerations more closely, leading to the establishment of DTCO as a crucial discipline within semiconductor technology.

### 기술 발전
Recent advancements in DTCO have been driven by the development of new materials, such as High-k dielectrics and FinFET structures. These innovations have necessitated new modeling approaches that accurately capture the electrical characteristics of these advanced devices.
