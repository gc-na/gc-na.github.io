# Device Modeling (Taiwanese)

## 定義
Device Modeling refers to the mathematical and computational representation of semiconductor devices to predict their electrical behavior, performance, and reliability under various conditions. This process involves the use of physical and empirical models to interpret device characteristics, facilitating the design and optimization of electronic circuits and systems.

## 歷史背景與技術進展
The genesis of Device Modeling can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor technology in the 1960s. Initially, models were simple and focused primarily on the basic electrical characteristics of transistors, such as the Shockley model for diodes and the Ebers-Moll model for bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). As technology advanced, the need for more complex and accurate models emerged, leading to the development of the SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) simulator in the 1970s, which incorporated various models for MOSFETs and BJTs.

With the advent of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technologies, Device Modeling evolved to include advanced techniques such as the use of TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design) tools, which provide detailed simulations of the fabrication process alongside device behavior.
