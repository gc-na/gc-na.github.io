# DFT Automation (Taiwanese)

## Definition of DFT Automation

DFT Automation, or Design for Test Automation, refers to a set of methodologies and tools used in the semiconductor industry to improve the testability of integrated circuits (ICs). By integrating DFT techniques into the design phase of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), engineers can ensure that the chips can be efficiently tested during manufacturing. This approach minimizes defects, reduces costs, and enhances product reliability.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of DFT Automation can be traced back to the 1980s when the increasing complexity of IC designs necessitated more effective testing methods. As semiconductor technology progressed, traditional testing methods became inadequate. Innovations such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST) and scan-based testing emerged, allowing for better fault detection capabilities. 

In Taiwan, a significant player in the global semiconductor industry, DFT Automation has seen substantial advancements due to the high demand for reliable and scalable testing solutions. The advent of advanced node technologies (e.g., 7nm, 5nm) has further fueled the need for sophisticated DFT techniques to cope with the challenges posed by smaller geometries.
