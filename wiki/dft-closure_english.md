# DFT Closure (English)

## Definition of DFT Closure
Design for Testability (DFT) Closure refers to the stage in the integrated circuit (IC) design process where the DFT techniques are fully implemented, verified, and validated to ensure comprehensive test coverage. This process is crucial for identifying and addressing potential defects in semiconductor devices, particularly in complex circuits like Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). Achieving DFT Closure signifies that the design meets the required testability metrics and is ready for production testing.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of DFT originated in the 1980s as integrated circuits began to grow in complexity. Early DFT techniques, such as scan chains, allowed designers to effectively test and diagnose faults in digital circuits. Over the years, advancements in VLSI technology have necessitated the evolution of DFT strategies, leading to the development of various methodologies such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST), Boundary Scan, and more sophisticated fault models.

The advent of high-density technologies, shrinking geometries, and increased functionality in chips has driven the need for enhanced DFT capabilities. Modern DFT tools leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize test coverage and reduce test time, a significant advancement over traditional methods.
