# DFT for SoC (English)

## Definition of DFT for SoC

Design for Testability (DFT) for System on Chip (SoC) refers to a set of design techniques and methodologies that enhance the testability of integrated circuits, particularly SoCs. DFT is aimed at ensuring that the complex components embedded in an SoC can be efficiently tested for defects, faults, and performance issues after fabrication. The primary goal of DFT is to facilitate the detection of manufacturing defects, minimize the cost of testing, and ensure high reliability in semiconductor devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of DFT techniques dates back to the early days of integrated circuit design, but it gained significant momentum with the advent of SoCs in the late 1990s. As semiconductor technology advanced, the complexity of SoC designs increased, necessitating more sophisticated testing methodologies. Early DFT techniques included built-in self-test (BIST) and scan chain methodologies, which allowed designers to embed testing capabilities directly into the hardware.

With the introduction of advanced manufacturing processes, such as 7nm and 5nm nodes, the importance of DFT has become even more pronounced. Innovations like JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) and boundary scan have also contributed to the development of standardized testing approaches, enabling seamless integration with automated test equipment.
