# Die-to-Die Bonding (English)

## Definition
Die-to-Die Bonding (D2D bonding) refers to a semiconductor packaging technology that enables the direct attachment of multiple integrated circuit (IC) dies to form a single functional unit. This method facilitates the interconnection of various chips, allowing them to communicate with each other at high speeds while significantly reducing the overall footprint and enhancing performance. D2D bonding is integral in the fabrication of multi-die systems, such as System-on-Chip (SoC) and heterogeneous integration.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
Die-to-Die bonding has evolved alongside the semiconductor industry, driven by the demand for miniaturization and increased performance. The early 2000s saw the introduction of flip-chip technology, which allowed for more efficient electrical connections between the die and the substrate. This advancement laid the groundwork for D2D bonding techniques, which gained traction with the advent of advanced packaging methodologies, including 2.5D and 3D IC architectures.

Technological advancements in materials science, such as the development of ultra-thin bonding adhesives and improved alignment techniques, have further enhanced D2D bonding capabilities. The integration of sophisticated equipment for precision alignment and bonding processes has also contributed to the widespread adoption of this technology.
