# Differential Signaling (English)

## Definition of Differential Signaling

Differential signaling is a transmission technique that uses two complementary signals to convey information. In a differential signaling system, two conductors carry equal and opposite signals, allowing the receiver to determine the transmitted data by comparing the voltage difference between the two wires. This method enhances signal integrity, reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), and improves noise immunity, making it a preferred choice in high-speed and long-distance data communication applications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Differential signaling has its roots in early communication technologies but gained significant traction with the advent of modern digital systems in the late 20th century. The introduction of technologies such as Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) in the 1990s marked a pivotal advancement. LVDS enables high-speed data transmission while maintaining low power consumption, thus becoming a standard in various applications like telecommunications and high-performance computing.

Recent advancements in semiconductor technology have allowed for the integration of differential signaling into Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), enhancing their performance and reliability.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Signal Integrity

Signal integrity is a fundamental concern in differential signaling. It refers to the quality of an electrical signal as it travels through a transmission medium. Factors such as impedance matching, crosstalk, and reflections can significantly impact the effectiveness of differential signaling.

### Noise Immunity

Differential signaling's inherent noise immunity arises from its ability to reject common-mode noise. Since both signals are transmitted over paired conductors, any noise that affects one conductor will likely affect the other in the same way, allowing the receiver to filter this noise out.

### Comparison: Differential Signaling vs. Single-Ended Signaling

| Feature                  | Differential Signaling           | Single-Ended Signaling         |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Signal Representation     | Two complementary signals        | One signal referenced to ground |
| Noise Immunity            | High (common-mode rejection)     | Low (more susceptible to noise) |
| Power Consumption          | Generally lower                  | Higher due to ground reference   |
| Transmission Distance      | Longer distances achievable       | Shorter distances recommended    |
| Complexity                | More complex circuitry            | Simpler circuitry                |
