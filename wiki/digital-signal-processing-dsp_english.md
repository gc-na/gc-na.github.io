# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) (English)

## Definition of Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is a subfield of signal processing that involves the manipulation of signals—such as sound, images, and sensor data—after they have been converted into a digital format. DSP employs algorithms and mathematical techniques to analyze, modify, and synthesize signals for various applications, leveraging the computational power of digital computers and specialized hardware such as Digital Signal Processors (DSP chips) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The primary goal of DSP is to improve signal quality and extract useful information while suppressing noise and irrelevant data.

## Historical Background

### Early Developments

The roots of Digital Signal Processing can be traced back to the 1960s when researchers began to explore the potential of digital computation for handling signals. The advent of the microprocessor in the 1970s marked a significant milestone, as it enabled real-time processing of signals in various applications. Early DSP systems were primarily used in telecommunications, where they facilitated noise reduction and signal enhancement.

### Technological Advancements

The 1980s and 1990s saw rapid advancements in DSP technology, driven by increasing computational power and the development of dedicated DSP chips. The introduction of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms revolutionized frequency analysis, enabling efficient processing of signals in the frequency domain. During this period, applications expanded to include audio processing, image processing, and radar systems.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends
