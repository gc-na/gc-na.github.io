# Digital Signal Processing (English)

## Definition of Digital Signal Processing

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) refers to the manipulation and analysis of signals that have been converted into a digital form. This field involves the use of algorithms and mathematical techniques to perform operations on digital signals for various applications, such as filtering, compression, and feature extraction. DSP is essential in converting analog signals into digital formats and subsequently processing them for various uses, including audio, video, and communication systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of Digital Signal Processing can be traced back to the 1960s with the advent of digital computers and the increasing need for more sophisticated signal analysis methods. The development of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm by Cooley and Tukey in 1965 marked a significant milestone, enabling efficient computation of frequency domain representations. 

By the 1980s, advancements in microprocessor technology and the introduction of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) facilitated the practical implementation of DSP algorithms in consumer electronics. The emergence of Digital Signal Processors, specialized microprocessors designed specifically for DSP tasks, further propelled the field, leading to real-time processing capabilities in applications ranging from telecommunications to multimedia.
