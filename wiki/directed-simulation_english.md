# Directed Simulation (English)

## Definition of Directed Simulation

Directed Simulation is a computational technique used primarily in the fields of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems for the purpose of modeling, testing, and validating complex integrated circuits and systems. This method employs a directed approach to simulate the behavior of circuits under specific conditions, utilizing algorithms that prioritize certain paths or activities based on predefined criteria. The primary goal of Directed Simulation is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the simulation process by focusing computational resources on the most relevant scenarios.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of simulation in electronics dates back to the mid-20th century, with the advent of early computers that could model simple electronic circuits. However, as the complexity of circuits increased, especially with the introduction of VLSI technology in the 1970s, conventional simulation methods struggled to keep pace. Directed Simulation emerged as a solution to address the inefficiencies of previous methods, allowing engineers to specify conditions and pathways to test.

In the 1980s and 1990s, advancements in algorithms and computational power facilitated the development of sophisticated Directed Simulation tools, such as those incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence. These technologies enabled simulations that were not only faster but also more aligned with real-world conditions.
