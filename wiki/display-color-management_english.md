# Display Color Management (English)

## Definition of Display Color Management

Display Color Management (DCM) refers to the systematic approach used to control and optimize the color output of display devices, ensuring color fidelity and consistency across different screens and mediums. DCM encompasses a range of techniques and technologies aimed at managing color profiles, calibrating displays, and facilitating accurate color reproduction in digital imaging and video applications. By utilizing color management systems (CMS), DCM allows for the standardization of color representation, which is crucial in professional fields such as photography, graphic design, and video production.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of color management emerged in the late 20th century with the increasing digitization of images and the need for consistent color across devices. In 1993, the International Color Consortium (ICC) was established to promote the adoption of standard color management workflows. The introduction of the ICC profile format in 1994 revolutionized the way colors were managed across devices, allowing for device-independent color representation.

Over the years, advancements in display technologies, including LCD, OLED, and microLED, have necessitated more sophisticated DCM techniques. Enhanced color gamuts, such as Adobe RGB and DCI-P3, have further complicated the landscape, requiring advanced calibration methods and color profiles to ensure accurate color reproduction.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Color Spaces and Profiles

DCM relies on a variety of color spaces, such as sRGB, Adobe RGB, and CIE XYZ. Each color space defines a specific range of colors that can be represented, and color profiles map these spaces to the physical characteristics of a display device.

### Calibration and Profiling

Calibration is the process of adjusting a display's settings to match a known standard, while profiling involves creating a color profile that describes how the display reproduces colors. Tools such as colorimeters and spectrophotometers are commonly used in these processes to ensure precise measurements.

### Color Management Systems

A Color Management System (CMS) is software that translates color information between different devices and color spaces. Popular CMS tools include Adobe Photoshop, DisplayCAL, and X-Rite i1Profiler, which allow users to create and apply accurate color profiles for their displays.

## Latest Trends in Display Color Management

### High Dynamic Range (HDR)

The rise of High Dynamic Range (HDR) content has introduced new challenges for DCM, requiring displays to reproduce a broader range of brightness and color. This necessitates advanced calibration techniques to maintain color accuracy across varying luminance levels.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have begun to influence DCM. These technologies are being used to automate the calibration process and improve the accuracy of color reproduction by analyzing large datasets of color information.

### Wide Color Gamuts

The adoption of wide color gamuts, such as DCI-P3 and Rec. 2020, has prompted advancements in DCM technologies. Display manufacturers are increasingly focusing on achieving higher color accuracy and ensuring compatibility with these expanded gamuts.
