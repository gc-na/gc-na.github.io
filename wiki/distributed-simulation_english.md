# Distributed Simulation (English)

## Definition of Distributed Simulation

Distributed Simulation refers to a simulation methodology that enables the execution of simulation models across multiple computing nodes within a network. This approach allows for the parallel processing of complex systems, enhancing performance, scalability, and resource utilization. By distributing the computational workload, distributed simulation facilitates the modeling of large-scale systems that may be impractical to simulate on a single machine.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of distributed simulation emerged in the late 20th century alongside advancements in computer networking and high-performance computing. Early implementations were primarily focused on military and defense applications, where large-scale simulations of battlefield scenarios were essential. The introduction of the High-Level Architecture (HLA) in the 1990s marked a significant milestone, providing a standardized framework for distributed simulations that enabled interoperability among different simulation systems.

Recent technological advancements in multi-core processors, cloud computing, and grid computing have further propelled the capabilities of distributed simulation. These developments allow for the simulation of increasingly complex systems, such as urban environments, biological systems, and advanced manufacturing processes.
