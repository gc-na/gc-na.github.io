# Edge Computing (English)

## Definition of Edge Computing

Edge Computing refers to a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location of the data generation. This approach minimizes latency, reduces bandwidth use, and enhances the performance of applications by processing data near the source, rather than relying solely on centralized cloud data centers. By leveraging local devices—such as sensors, gateways, and microdata centers—Edge Computing facilitates real-time data processing and analytics, making it critical for applications that require immediate insights and actions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Edge Computing emerged in response to the growing demand for real-time data processing and the limitations of traditional cloud computing architectures. The origins can be traced back to the late 2000s, when advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies began to proliferate. As devices became increasingly interconnected, the need for localized data processing grew, leading to the development of Edge Computing solutions.

Key technological advancements that have propelled Edge Computing include:

- **IoT Proliferation:** The expansion of IoT devices has created vast amounts of data that necessitate immediate processing capabilities.
- **5G Networks:** The rollout of 5G technology has provided high-speed, low-latency connectivity, making it feasible to deploy edge solutions effectively.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The integration of AI algorithms at the edge allows for intelligent data processing and decision-making close to the data source.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Edge Computing vs. Cloud Computing

**Edge Computing** and **Cloud Computing** represent two paradigms in data processing:
