# eDP (English)

## Definition of eDP

Embedded DisplayPort (eDP) is a high-performance digital interface designed specifically for internal connections between a video source, such as a graphics processing unit (GPU), and a display device, such as an LCD or OLED panel. eDP is a variant of the DisplayPort standard, optimized for use in laptops, tablets, and other portable devices, facilitating high-resolution video transmission with minimal power consumption and reduced physical footprint.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Evolution of Display Interfaces

The development of eDP can be traced back to the increasing demand for higher resolution displays and the need for efficient power management in portable devices. Introduced by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) in 2010, eDP was created to address the limitations of previous display interfaces, such as LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) and traditional DisplayPort, which were not optimized for the compact form factors and power constraints of modern electronic devices.

### Technological Milestones

- **eDP 1.0 (2010)**: The initial version introduced support for resolutions up to 2560x1600 at 60Hz, along with power management features like Panel Self Refresh (PSR).
- **eDP 1.3 (2012)**: This iteration expanded bandwidth capabilities, allowing for 4K resolutions (3840x2160) at 60Hz and introduced support for Display Stream Compression (DSC).
- **eDP 1.4 (2014)**: Further enhancements included improved support for HDR (High Dynamic Range) content and a more efficient power-saving mode.
- **eDP 2.0 (2020)**: The latest version significantly increases bandwidth, enabling support for 8K displays and advanced features for enhanced visual experiences.
