# Electrical Testing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Electrical Testing

Electrical Testing refers to the systematic evaluation of electrical and electronic devices to ensure their performance, safety, and compliance with specified standards. This process encompasses a variety of techniques aimed at assessing the functionality, reliability, and longevity of components, such as integrated circuits and circuit boards. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, electrical testing plays a crucial role in the verification of designs and the quality assurance of manufacturing processes.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of electrical testing can be traced back to the early 20th century with the development of basic electrical measurement tools. However, significant advancements began with the introduction of semiconductor devices in the late 1940s. The rise of Integrated Circuits (ICs) in the 1960s necessitated more sophisticated testing methods to handle the increasing complexity of these devices.

#### Milestones in Electrical Testing

- **1970s**: The introduction of Automated Test Equipment (ATE) revolutionized testing by allowing high-speed testing of multiple devices simultaneously.
- **1980s**: The emergence of Boundary Scan technology provided a new method for testing interconnections on printed circuit boards (PCBs).
- **1990s**: The development of Built-In Self-Test (BIST) techniques improved the testability of ICs by incorporating testing functions directly into the circuit design.
