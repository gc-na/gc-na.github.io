# Electrostatics Simulation (English)

## Definition of Electrostatics Simulation

Electrostatics Simulation refers to the computational modeling and analysis of electric fields and potentials generated by static electric charges. This simulation is essential for understanding the behavior of electronic devices and systems, particularly in the design of integrated circuits, MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), and other semiconductor technologies. Electrostatics simulations utilize numerical methods, such as Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), and Boundary Element Method (BEM), to solve Maxwell's equations under static conditions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of simulating electrostatic fields dates back to the early developments in electromagnetism in the 19th century. Initial analytical methods were limited to simple geometries and charge distributions. With the advent of computers in the mid-20th century, numerical methods became more prevalent, enabling complex simulations that were previously unfeasible.

### Key Milestones:
