# Embedded Display Controller (English)

## Definition
An Embedded Display Controller (EDC) is a specialized component integrated within a semiconductor device that manages the display functionalities of electronic systems. The EDC interfaces directly with display panels, controlling tasks such as pixel rendering, video processing, and data management for graphical output. It is commonly found in devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and automotive displays.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The development of Embedded Display Controllers can be traced back to the evolution of graphic user interfaces and the rapid advancement in display technologies. Early display controllers were discrete components used in conjunction with microprocessors. As the demand for higher resolution displays and more complex graphics increased, the need for integrated solutions became apparent. 

In the early 2000s, with the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and the introduction of System on Chip (SoC) architectures, EDCs became more integrated. Today, they often reside within SoCs, which combine multiple functions into a single chip, enhancing performance and reducing power consumption.
