# Emerging Memory (English)

## Definition of Emerging Memory

Emerging Memory refers to a class of non-volatile memory technologies that are currently under development or have recently been commercialized, offering advantages over traditional memory types such as DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) and NAND flash memory. These technologies are designed to meet the increasing demands for performance, scalability, and energy efficiency in various applications, including mobile devices, data centers, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Emerging memory encompasses a variety of technologies, including but not limited to Resistive RAM (ReRAM), Phase Change Memory (PCM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), and Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM).

## Historical Background

The quest for improved memory technologies can be traced back to the 1960s, with the advent of semiconductor memory. Traditional memory types, such as DRAM and NAND flash, have dominated the landscape for decades. However, as the demand for high-performance computing and data storage escalated, researchers began exploring alternative memory technologies that could overcome the limitations of existing solutions.

Technological advancements, particularly in materials science and nanoscale fabrication techniques, have spurred interest in emerging memory technologies. For instance, the discovery of new phase change materials in the early 2000s led to the development of PCM, while progress in spintronics facilitated the emergence of MRAM.
