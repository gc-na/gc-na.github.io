# Error Injection (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Error Injection
Error Injection refers to the deliberate introduction of faults or errors into a system, particularly in the context of integrated circuits and software applications, to assess the robustness and reliability of these systems. This technique is essential for validating error detection and correction mechanisms, assessing fault tolerance, and evaluating the overall resilience of semiconductor devices and VLSI systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of Error Injection has its roots in the early days of computing and semiconductor technology, where system failures were often catastrophic. As technology advanced, the need for more reliable systems became paramount, leading to the development of various error detection and correction techniques. In the 1980s, researchers began systematically exploring Error Injection as a method for testing VLSI designs, focusing on both hardware and software.

Over the past few decades, technological advancements in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-level synthesis have further refined Error Injection methodologies. These advancements enable more intelligent and automated approaches to fault simulation, allowing for rapid testing of complex systems.
