# EUV DTCO (English)

## Definition of EUV DTCO

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) refers to a systematic approach that integrates design and technology to enhance the performance and manufacturability of semiconductor devices utilizing EUV lithography. This methodology emphasizes the co-design of circuit layouts, process technologies, and manufacturing capabilities to maximize the efficacy of EUV lithography, which operates at wavelengths around 13.5 nm, significantly smaller than traditional lithography methods.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of EUV DTCO is rooted in the exponential growth of semiconductor technology, which has followed Moore's Law for decades. As transistors became smaller, traditional optical lithography faced challenges in producing features at nanometer scales. The development of EUV lithography emerged in the late 1990s, promising to extend the capabilities of semiconductor manufacturing.

Significant advancements in EUV technology occurred in the 2010s, with the first commercial EUV lithography machines introduced by ASML. These machines use a plasma source to generate EUV light, allowing for the production of smaller, more densely packed transistors on chips. The integration of EUV with DTCO principles has enabled the semiconductor industry to tackle complex challenges in design, such as variability in manufacturing processes and increased power consumption.
