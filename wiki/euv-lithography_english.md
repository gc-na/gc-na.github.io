# EUV Lithography (English)

## Definition of EUV Lithography

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography is a cutting-edge photolithography technique used in semiconductor manufacturing. It employs extreme ultraviolet light, typically with a wavelength of around 13.5 nanometers, to pattern the microstructures on semiconductor wafers. This technology enables the production of smaller, denser, and more energy-efficient integrated circuits, which are crucial for advancing modern electronics.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of EUV lithography emerged in the late 20th century as the semiconductor industry sought to overcome the limitations of traditional optical lithography, which uses ultraviolet light with longer wavelengths (typically 193 nm). With the continuous miniaturization of electronic components, traditional photolithography faced challenges in achieving the necessary resolution for patterning features smaller than 20 nm.

### Key Milestones in EUV Development

- **1980s:** Initial research into EUV sources and optics began, with the first experimental EUV lithography systems developed.
- **1999:** The first successful demonstration of EUV lithography for patterning semiconductor features was achieved.
- **2010:** The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) identified EUV lithography as a critical technology for future nodes.
- **2015:** The first commercial applications of EUV lithography began, with the introduction of ASML's NXE series of lithography machines.

## Engineering Fundamentals of EUV Lithography

### Light Source

EUV lithography requires a specialized light source to generate the extreme ultraviolet radiation. The most common method involves using a plasma created by firing high-energy lasers at a target material, typically tin, which emits EUV light.

### Optics

Due to the short wavelength of EUV light, traditional lenses cannot be used. Instead, reflective optics, primarily made of multilayer coatings, are employed to focus and direct the EUV beams onto the wafer surface.

### Resist Materials

The photoresist materials used in EUV lithography must be sensitive to EUV light and capable of forming high-resolution patterns. The development of novel resist materials is crucial for achieving the desired pattern fidelity and resolution.
