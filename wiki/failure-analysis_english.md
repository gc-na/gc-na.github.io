# Failure Analysis (English)

## Definition of Failure Analysis
Failure Analysis (FA) is a systematic investigation of failures in materials, components, systems, or processes to identify their causes and effects. This discipline encompasses various methodologies and technologies to dissect and analyze failures, often employing techniques from metallurgy, materials science, and engineering. The primary objective is to enhance product reliability, improve safety, and inform design improvements, making it a critical aspect of engineering and manufacturing industries.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The roots of Failure Analysis can be traced back to the early 20th century when the need for improved engineering practices became evident following several catastrophic failures in structural engineering, such as bridge collapses and mechanical failures in machinery. The establishment of the field was significantly advanced during World War II, where rigorous testing and failure investigations were critical to military applications.

With the advent of semiconductor technology in the latter half of the 20th century, Failure Analysis began to evolve rapidly. The introduction of integrated circuits and more complex VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems necessitated sophisticated analysis techniques to ensure reliability and performance. The development of advanced microscopy techniques, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), has significantly enhanced the capabilities of Failure Analysis in characterizing failure modes at the nanoscale.
