# Failure Analysis (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Failure Analysis (FA) refers to the systematic investigation of a failure in a semiconductor device or system to identify the root cause of the failure. This process is essential in the semiconductor industry to ensure product reliability, enhance yields, and maintain customer satisfaction. FA typically employs various analytical techniques and methodologies to dissect the failure mechanism, which can include electrical, physical, and chemical analyses.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The concept of Failure Analysis has evolved significantly since the inception of semiconductor technology in the mid-20th century. Initially, FA was primarily concerned with simple visual inspections and basic electrical tests. However, the growing complexity of semiconductor devices, such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), has necessitated more advanced analytical techniques.

In the 1980s and 1990s, advancements in microscopy, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), revolutionized the field of FA. These tools allowed engineers to examine materials at the nanoscale, leading to a more profound understanding of failure mechanisms such as electromigration and thermal fatigue.
