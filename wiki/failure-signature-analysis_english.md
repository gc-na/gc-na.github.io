# Failure Signature Analysis (English)

## Definition

Failure Signature Analysis (FSA) is a diagnostic technique utilized in semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems to identify and classify defects in integrated circuits (ICs) by analyzing the electrical characteristics or “signatures” of failing devices. This method involves capturing the unique electrical response of a chip under specific test conditions, enabling engineers to pinpoint failure modes and understand the underlying causes of malfunctions.

## Historical Background

The evolution of Failure Signature Analysis can be traced back to the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices in the 1980s and 1990s, necessitating advanced diagnostic methods to improve yield and reliability. With the advent of deep submicron technology and the proliferation of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), traditional testing methodologies became inadequate. As a result, FSA emerged as a critical tool, integrating principles of electrical engineering, material science, and data analysis.

Technological advancements such as automated test equipment (ATE) and enhanced data processing capabilities have significantly improved the efficacy of FSA, allowing for real-time analysis and faster turnaround times.
