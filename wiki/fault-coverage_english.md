# Fault Coverage (English)

## Definition of Fault Coverage
Fault coverage is a critical metric in the field of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems that quantifies the effectiveness of a test procedure in detecting potential faults within an integrated circuit (IC). It is defined as the ratio of the number of detectable faults to the total number of faults in a given circuit under a specific test set, typically expressed as a percentage. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

\[ \text{Fault Coverage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Detectable Faults}}{\text{Total Number of Faults}} \right) \times 100 \]

A higher fault coverage percentage indicates a more effective testing strategy, ensuring that the majority of potential defects are identified during the manufacturing and operational phases of the IC.

## Historical Background
The concept of fault coverage emerged with the advent of automated testing in the 1970s, coinciding with the growth of VLSI technology. Early testing methods primarily focused on simple stuck-at faults, where a signal is permanently fixed at a logical high or low level. As semiconductor technology progressed and designs became more complex, the need for more sophisticated test methodologies arose, leading to the introduction of various fault models, including transition faults, bridging faults, and delay faults.

Technological advancements, such as the development of Design for Testability (DFT) techniques, have significantly improved fault coverage. Techniques like scan chains, built-in self-test (BIST), and boundary scan have enabled deeper insights into IC behavior, enhancing the ability to detect faults.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
### Test Patterns and Fault Models
Fault coverage is intimately related to the design of test patterns and fault models. Common fault models include:
- **Stuck-at Fault Model:** Assumes that a node in a circuit is permanently set to a logical high or low.
- **Bridging Fault Model:** Considers faults that occur when two or more nodes in a circuit become electrically connected.
- **Delay Fault Model:** Addresses timing-related faults caused by variations in circuit delay.

### Design for Testability (DFT)
DFT techniques are essential for achieving high fault coverage. They include:
- **Scan Testing:** Incorporates scan flip-flops that allow for easier access to internal states during testing.
- **Built-In Self-Test (BIST):** Embeds test circuitry within the IC to facilitate self-testing.
- **Boundary Scan:** Provides a method for testing interconnections between ICs in a system.
