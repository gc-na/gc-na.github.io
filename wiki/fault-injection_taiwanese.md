# Fault Injection (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Fault Injection

Fault Injection is a testing technique used in the field of computer engineering and semiconductor technology to assess the robustness and reliability of systems, particularly in embedded systems and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). By deliberately introducing faults—such as transient errors, permanent faults, or even design errors—engineers can observe how a system responds to failures, thereby identifying vulnerabilities and enhancing fault tolerance.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Fault Injection emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the complexity of electronic systems increased significantly. The need for reliable systems was accentuated by the growing use of electronics in critical applications such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices. Initially, fault injection techniques were primarily software-based, allowing developers to simulate faults within a controlled environment. However, advancements in hardware technologies and the advent of sophisticated debugging tools have led to more sophisticated fault injection methodologies, including:

- **Hardware Fault Injection**: Utilizing specialized hardware to introduce faults at the circuit level.
- **Software Fault Injection**: Modifying code to simulate faults in a software environment.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining both hardware and software techniques for comprehensive testing.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Reliability Engineering

Reliability engineering plays a critical role in Fault Injection, emphasizing the design and testing of systems to ensure they perform reliably under expected conditions. Key concepts include Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) and Fault Tolerance, which are directly related to the effectiveness of Fault Injection methods.

### Test Automation

Test automation frameworks, including Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, increasingly incorporate Fault Injection to validate system resilience in real-time development environments.
