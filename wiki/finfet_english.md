#FinFET (English)

## Definition of FinFET

FinFET, or Fin Field-Effect Transistor, is a type of non-planar transistor used in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes. It is characterized by a three-dimensional structure that resembles a fin, allowing for greater control over the channel through which current flows. FinFETs are pivotal in modern microelectronics and are instrumental in minimizing short-channel effects, thus improving performance and power efficiency in integrated circuits.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The development of FinFET technology emerged in the early 2000s as a response to the limitations of traditional planar MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors). As transistors continued to shrink in size, planar devices faced significant challenges, including increased leakage currents and reduced electrostatic control over the channel. 

In 2001, researchers at Stanford University introduced the FinFET concept, presenting a solution that utilized a three-dimensional structure to enhance gate control. The first commercial applications of FinFET technology began around 2012 with the introduction of Intel's 22nm process technology, marking a significant milestone in the semiconductor industry.
