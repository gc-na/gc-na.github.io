# Flexible Electronics (English)

## Definition of Flexible Electronics

Flexible electronics, also known as flexible circuits or flex circuits, refer to electronic devices and circuits that are built on flexible substrates. Unlike traditional rigid electronics, which are typically manufactured on hard materials like silicon wafers, flexible electronics utilize materials such as plastic, paper, or cloth. This allows them to bend, twist, and conform to various shapes and surfaces without losing functionality. The technology encompasses a range of components, including transistors, sensors, and displays, enabling innovative applications in various sectors.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of flexible electronics began to take shape in the late 20th century, primarily driven by advancements in materials science and printing technologies. Initial research focused on organic electronics, which utilize organic semiconductors to fabricate transistors and diodes on flexible substrates. 

In the early 2000s, the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) marked a significant milestone. Companies like Kodak and Universal Display Corporation pioneered the commercialization of OLED technology, which laid the foundation for flexible displays. The introduction of roll-to-roll manufacturing processes further accelerated the growth of flexible electronics by allowing mass production of electronic components on flexible materials.
