# Foundry Competition (English)

## Definition of Foundry Competition

Foundry Competition refers to the competitive landscape among semiconductor foundries that manufacture integrated circuits (ICs) for various applications including consumer electronics, automotive systems, and telecommunications. Foundries provide fabrication services to design companies, allowing them to focus on design and innovation while outsourcing the manufacturing process. The competition is characterized by technological advancements, pricing strategies, and capacity enhancements, driving the development of cutting-edge semiconductor technologies.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The semiconductor foundry model emerged in the late 20th century, with companies like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) pioneering this approach in the 1980s. This model enabled fabless semiconductor companies to thrive by outsourcing fabrication. Over the decades, technological advancements such as Moore's Law have pushed foundries to continually innovate in lithography techniques, process nodes, and materials, enabling the production of smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient chips.
