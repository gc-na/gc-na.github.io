# Foundry Services (English)

## Definition of Foundry Services

Foundry services, in the context of semiconductor manufacturing, refer to the provision of fabrication capabilities for integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices by specialized companies known as foundries. These services enable companies, particularly fabless semiconductor firms, to produce their designs without the need to invest in and maintain their own fabrication facilities. Foundries typically operate on a contract basis, taking designs from clients and translating them into physical silicon chips through various manufacturing processes.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of foundry services emerged in the early 1980s, driven by the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing and the demand for specialized expertise. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) pioneered the foundry model, allowing fabless companies to focus on design while outsourcing manufacturing.

Technological advancements have significantly transformed foundry services, especially with the introduction of advanced process nodes. The transition from 90nm to 7nm technology nodes marked a pivotal point in the industry, enabling higher transistor densities, improved power efficiency, and enhanced performance. Innovations in lithography techniques, such as Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, have further enabled the production of smaller and more complex devices.

## Engineering Fundamentals and Related Technologies

### VLSI Technology

Foundry services are intrinsically linked to Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) technology, which involves the integration of thousands to millions of transistors on a single chip. VLSI design encompasses a variety of methodologies, including digital, analog, and mixed-signal designs. Foundries provide the necessary infrastructure to fabricate these designs, including photolithography, etching, doping, and chemical vapor deposition techniques.

### Design for Manufacturing (DFM)

Design for Manufacturing (DFM) is an essential principle that guides the design process to ensure that integrated circuits can be efficiently manufactured. Foundries collaborate with design teams to optimize layouts and designs to minimize defects, reduce manufacturing costs, and improve yield rates.

### Process Technology

Foundry services encompass a wide range of process technologies, including Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS), silicon-on-insulator (SOI), and gallium nitride (GaN) technologies. Each technology is suited for specific applications, influencing the performance, power consumption, and overall characteristics of the fabricated devices.

## Latest Trends in Foundry Services

### Advanced Node Manufacturing

As the industry pushes towards smaller nodes (5nm and below), foundries are investing heavily in R&D to develop new materials and processes. The use of FinFET technology and the exploration of new semiconductor materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, are critical trends in this area.

### Heterogeneous Integration

Heterogeneous integration involves combining different technologies and materials on a single chip, enabling the integration of diverse functionalities. This trend is driven by the demand for System-on-Chip (SoC) solutions, where various components, including processors, memory, and sensors, are integrated to enhance performance and reduce size.

### Sustainability and Green Manufacturing

With increasing awareness of environmental issues, foundries are adopting sustainable practices. Efforts are being made to reduce water and energy consumption during manufacturing, as well as to develop eco-friendly materials and processes.

## Major Applications of Foundry Services

Foundry services cater to various sectors, including:

- **Consumer Electronics:** Smartphones, tablets, and wearables.
