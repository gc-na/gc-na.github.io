# Foundry Services (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Foundry Services

Foundry Services refer to the manufacturing processes and capabilities offered by semiconductor foundries to design houses and integrated circuit (IC) developers. These services primarily include the fabrication of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and other semiconductor devices, leveraging advanced manufacturing technologies to produce chips that meet specific performance and functionality requirements. Foundry services play a crucial role in the semiconductor industry, allowing companies to outsource their fabrication processes and focus on design and innovation.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The semiconductor industry in Taiwan began to take shape in the early 1980s, with the establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987, which pioneered the foundry model. This model allowed companies without fabrication facilities to produce custom chips, leading to rapid growth in the IC industry. Over the years, Taiwanese foundries have embraced numerous technological advancements, including:

- **Process Technology Development:** Continuous improvement in process nodes, down to the 5nm and 3nm technologies, significantly enhancing performance, power efficiency, and transistor density.
- **FinFET Technology:** Introduction of Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) technology has enabled better control over short-channel effects, improving the performance of transistors at smaller process nodes.
- **3D IC Packaging:** Advancements in packaging technologies such as 3D stacking and System-on-Chip (SoC) integration have allowed for more compact and efficient designs.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Semiconductor Fabrication Processes

The primary processes involved in semiconductor fabrication include:

- **Photolithography:** A critical process used to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers.
- **Etching:** Used to remove layers of material from the wafer to create desired patterns.
- **Deposition:** Involves the application of thin films of materials onto the wafer, which can include Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD).

### Engineering Fundamentals

Foundry services are grounded in several engineering principles, including:

- **Electrical Engineering:** Understanding the behavior of electrical circuits and the design of electronic components.
