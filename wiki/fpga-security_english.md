# FPGA Security (English)

## Definition of FPGA Security
FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) security refers to the safeguarding of FPGA devices and their associated intellectual property (IP) from unauthorized access, tampering, and malicious attacks. As FPGAs become increasingly prevalent in various applications, ensuring their security has become vital to protecting sensitive data, maintaining system integrity, and preventing exploitation of vulnerabilities.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
FPGAs were first introduced in the mid-1980s, enabling designers to implement custom digital circuits without the need for hardwired Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). As technology progressed, FPGAs evolved in complexity, capacity, and performance. Early FPGAs had limited security features, primarily focused on physical protection. However, with the rise of digital threats and the increasing complexity of designs, FPGA security has gained prominence.

The introduction of features such as configuration encryption, secure boot mechanisms, and tamper-resistant packaging has marked significant advancements in FPGA security. Recent technological innovations, such as the development of 5nm process technology, Gate-All-Around (GAA) FETs, and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, have further enhanced the capabilities of FPGAs, allowing for more sophisticated security measures to be integrated directly into the hardware.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### 5nm Process Technology
The 5nm process technology represents one of the most advanced semiconductor fabrication techniques available, allowing for denser integration of transistors. This increased transistor density not only enhances performance but also improves the feasibility of implementing complex security algorithms directly within the FPGA architecture.

### Gate-All-Around (GAA) FET
GAA FETs, an emerging transistor architecture, offer greater control over short-channel effects and improved electrostatic integrity. By integrating GAA structures in FPGA designs, manufacturers can enhance the resilience of FPGAs against side-channel attacks and other forms of exploitation.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography
EUV lithography is revolutionizing semiconductor manufacturing by enabling the production of smaller features on chips. This technology allows for more intricate designs and the integration of advanced security features, such as hardware-based key storage and secure communication protocols.

## Major Applications

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
FPGAs are widely used in AI applications for their ability to handle parallel processing tasks efficiently. Security in AI FPGA implementations is crucial, especially in safeguarding proprietary algorithms and preventing model theft.

### Networking
In networking, FPGAs serve critical roles in packet processing and data management. Ensuring the security of FPGA-based networking devices is vital for protecting against data breaches and cyberattacks.

### Computing
FPGAs are increasingly adopted in data centers and high-performance computing environments. Their security is paramount to protect sensitive computations and maintain system integrity against potential intrusions.

### Automotive
As vehicles become more connected and autonomous, the need for secure FPGA applications in automotive systems has surged. Protection against unauthorized access and manipulation of critical vehicle functions is essential for safety and compliance with regulatory standards.
