# FPGA (English)

## Definition of FPGA

A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed and reconfigured after manufacturing. Unlike Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are designed for a specific task, FPGAs offer flexibility and adaptability, making them ideal for a wide range of applications. They consist of an array of programmable logic blocks, interconnects, and I/O pins, allowing users to create custom hardware configurations tailored to specific requirements.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

FPGAs emerged in the mid-1980s, with the first commercially available device, the XC2064, released by Xilinx in 1985. This innovation marked a shift in digital design methodologies, allowing engineers to prototype designs rapidly without the need for costly and time-consuming fabrication processes typical of ASIC development.

### Early Developments

The early FPGAs were based on static RAM (SRAM) technology, which provided the capability to reprogram the logic configurations. Over the years, advancements in semiconductor technology, including the introduction of smaller process nodes, enhanced the performance, density, and functionality of FPGAs.

### Technological Advancements

The transition to sub-micron technologies in the 1990s led to the development of more complex FPGAs, incorporating features such as embedded memory blocks, digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities, and high-speed transceivers. Notably, the introduction of 3D IC packaging and integration of non-volatile memory technologies, such as Flash, have further expanded the versatility and application scope of FPGAs.

- **Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV):** EUV lithography is a game changer for semiconductor manufacturing, allowing for smaller feature sizes and more intricate designs, reducing the cost and time required to develop advanced FPGAs.

### Latest Trends

The convergence of FPGAs with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is reshaping the landscape of hardware design. FPGAs are increasingly being utilized for AI inference, thanks to their parallel processing capabilities and configurability. Additionally, the integration of FPGA technology into edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cloud infrastructure is becoming more prevalent.
