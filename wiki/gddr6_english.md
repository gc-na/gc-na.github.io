# GDDR6 (English)

## Definition of GDDR6

GDDR6, or Graphics Double Data Rate 6, is a high-speed memory interface designed primarily for graphics processing units (GPUs) and other high-performance computing applications. It is the successor to GDDR5X and offers enhanced performance, improved power efficiency, and higher bandwidth, making it suitable for demanding graphics applications such as gaming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The development of GDDR6 was driven by the growing need for faster memory solutions in the gaming and professional graphics markets. Introduced in 2018 by Micron Technology, GDDR6 was designed to address the limitations of its predecessor, GDDR5, and GDDR5X. Key advancements included a higher data rate, increased memory density, and improved power management features.

GDDR6 operates at data rates of up to 16 Gbps (gigabits per second) per pin, compared to GDDR5's maximum of 8 Gbps. The technology utilizes a 32-bit wide bus, resulting in a theoretical bandwidth of 512 GB/s when configured with multiple chips. These advancements are critical as the demand for high-resolution gaming and real-time ray tracing capabilities continues to rise.
