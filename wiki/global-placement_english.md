# Global Placement (English)

## Definition of Global Placement

Global Placement is a critical phase in the physical design process of integrated circuits (ICs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). It involves the arrangement of circuit components, such as standard cells and macros, within a predefined area of a semiconductor die while minimizing wire length, optimizing performance, and adhering to design rules. The primary goal of global placement is to create a layout that facilitates efficient routing of interconnections and meets the performance requirements of the circuit.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of global placement can be traced back to the early days of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology. As IC complexity increased, traditional manual placement methods became inefficient and error-prone. The introduction of algorithms for automated placement, particularly in the 1980s, marked a significant turning point in the field. Techniques such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms gained traction, allowing designers to explore the vast solution space more effectively.

Recent advancements have focused on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of global placement algorithms. These methods can analyze vast datasets from previous designs to predict optimal placements, significantly reducing the time required for the placement phase.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Placement Algorithms

The core of global placement revolves around various algorithms that determine the optimal arrangement of circuit elements. These include:

- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy to find a good approximation of the global optimum.
- **Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)**: A mathematical approach used to minimize the total distance of connections while assigning locations to modules.
- **Partitioning Algorithms**: These divide the circuit into smaller sub-circuits, making the placement problem more manageable.

### Routing

Once global placement is complete, the next critical step is routing, where interconnections between placed components are established. Effective global placement reduces congestion in routing, thereby improving overall circuit performance.

## Latest Trends in Global Placement

### Machine Learning Integration

Recent research has indicated a shift towards the integration of machine learning techniques in global placement. These methods can optimize the placement process by learning from past designs and adapting to new constraints in real-time, resulting in quicker and more efficient placements.

### Multi-Objective Optimization

Modern global placement tools are increasingly focusing on multi-objective optimization. This involves balancing trade-offs between various design metrics, such as area, performance, and power consumption. Designers are now equipped with tools that allow them to specify multiple objectives to be optimized simultaneously.

## Major Applications

Global placement is crucial in various applications, including:

- **Digital IC Design**: Essential for creating microprocessors, GPUs, and memory chips.
- **ASIC Development**: Used extensively in specialized chips for consumer electronics, automotive systems, and telecommunications.
- **System on Chip (SoC) Layout**: Important for integrating multiple components on a single chip, optimizing performance and minimizing power consumption.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions

### Emerging Technologies

Research is increasingly focused on adapting global placement methodologies for newer technologies like 3D ICs and advanced packaging solutions. These technologies present unique challenges that require innovative placement algorithms capable of handling vertical interconnections and complex thermal management.

### Quantum Computing

The advent of quantum computing is prompting researchers to explore how global placement can be adapted for quantum circuits. The unique properties of qubits necessitate novel placement strategies that differ from classical approaches.
