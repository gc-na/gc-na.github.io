# Global Placement (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Global Placement
Global Placement (GP) refers to the process of positioning the cells of an integrated circuit (IC) layout in such a manner that optimizes various performance metrics, such as area, timing, and power consumption. This process is a crucial step in the physical design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Complex Integrated Circuits (CICs), where the proper positioning of components impacts the overall efficiency and functionality of the chip.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of Global Placement has evolved significantly since the inception of VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) technology in the 1970s. Early methods of placement were predominantly manual, relying on designers' intuition and experience. However, as IC complexity increased, the need for automated tools became apparent. 

In the 1980s, pioneering algorithms like the simulated annealing and genetic algorithms were introduced, providing a foundation for more sophisticated placement techniques. The advent of advanced optimization techniques and heuristics in the 1990s, such as linear programming and partitioning methods, marked a significant leap forward in GP efficiency. Today, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence into placement algorithms is at the forefront of technological advancement, allowing for faster and more optimal solutions.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
### Algorithms and Heuristics
Global Placement employs a variety of algorithms to achieve optimal outcomes. Key methods include:
- **Simulated Annealing:** A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function, particularly useful in large search spaces.
- **Partitioning:** Dividing the circuit into smaller sections to simplify the placement problem. This method often utilizes spectral methods or recursive bisection.

### Design Rule Constraints
Global Placement must adhere to certain design rule constraints, including spacing, layer restrictions, and other manufacturing limitations. These constraints ensure that the final layout can be successfully fabricated without defects.

### Timing and Power Considerations
Placement strategies must consider timing closure and power distribution, as the arrangement of cells affects signal propagation delays and power dissipation across the chip.
