# Global Routing (English)

## Definition of Global Routing

Global Routing is a critical phase in the physical design process of Integrated Circuits (ICs), specifically in the context of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It involves the task of determining optimal paths for interconnections among various components of a circuit, such as logic gates, memory cells, and other functional blocks, while considering the constraints imposed by the physical layout and design rules. The objective of global routing is to ensure that all connections are made efficiently, minimizing the total wire length and ensuring signal integrity, while adhering to design specifications and manufacturing limitations.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of global routing can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor design when designers manually routed connections on silicon wafers. The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools in the 1980s revolutionized this process, leading to the development of algorithms that could automate routing tasks. Early global routing algorithms focused on minimizing congestion and optimizing wire length, using techniques such as maze routing and linear programming.

With advancements in semiconductor technology, including the transition to smaller process nodes, more complex routing problems have emerged. The introduction of multi-layered interconnects and the increasing complexity of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) have driven the need for more sophisticated global routing techniques, including the use of heuristic methods, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to enhance routing efficiency and accuracy.

## Engineering Fundamentals and Related Technologies

Global routing is closely related to several engineering fundamentals and technologies, including:

### Physical Design Flow

Global routing is part of the broader physical design flow, which includes stages like placement, global routing, detailed routing, and manufacturing preparation. Each of these stages must seamlessly integrate to ensure a functional and manufacturable design.

### Routing Algorithms

Various algorithms are employed in global routing, including:

- **Grid-Based Algorithms:** These divide the routing area into a grid and perform routing by considering grid cells.
- **Graph-Based Algorithms:** These represent the circuit as a graph, where nodes correspond to circuit components and edges represent potential routing paths.
- **Tree-Based Algorithms:** These focus on creating minimum spanning trees for connecting components, minimizing total wire length.

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

Global routing must comply with specific design rules related to spacing, width, and layer usage. Design Rule Checking ensures that the proposed routes adhere to these rules to avoid manufacturing defects.

## Latest Trends in Global Routing

Recent trends in global routing include:

- **Machine Learning and AI:** The integration of machine learning techniques has begun to play a significant role in improving routing efficiency and adaptability to design changes.
