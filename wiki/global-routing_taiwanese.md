# Global Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Global Routing

Global Routing is a crucial stage in the electronic design automation (EDA) process of integrated circuit (IC) design, particularly for complex VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. It primarily involves the planning and determination of the interconnections between different components on a semiconductor chip. This stage follows the placement of the circuit elements and precedes detailed routing, addressing the overall connectivity requirements while considering constraints such as area, power consumption, and signal integrity.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Global Routing emerged in the early stages of VLSI design in the 1980s when the integration of thousands of transistors onto a single chip became feasible. Initially, manual routing techniques dominated the field, but as design complexities increased, automated tools became essential. Key advancements included the development of algorithms that optimize routing paths and minimize the overall chip area while adhering to specific manufacturing rules.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the rise of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs further accelerated the need for efficient Global Routing solutions, leading to the introduction of sophisticated algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm. These methods enhanced the speed and accuracy of routing, allowing for the successful implementation of increasingly complex designs.
