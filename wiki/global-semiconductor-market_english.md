# Global Semiconductor Market (English)

## Definition
The Global Semiconductor Market refers to the international industry involved in the design, manufacturing, and distribution of semiconductor devices, which are essential components in electronic circuits. Semiconductors are materials that have conductivity between that of insulators and conductors, and they form the basis for various electronic devices, including transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits (ICs). This market encompasses a wide range of products, technologies, and applications, making it a pivotal sector in the global economy.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The semiconductor industry has undergone significant transformations since its inception in the mid-20th century. The development of the first transistor at Bell Laboratories in 1947 marked the beginning of the semiconductor era. Over the decades, the introduction of integrated circuits in the 1960s revolutionized electronics by allowing multiple functions to be combined into a single chip. 

The Moore's Law, articulated by Gordon Moore in 1965, predicted the exponential growth of transistor density on chips, leading to smaller, faster, and more efficient devices. This observation has largely held true, guiding the technological advancements in the semiconductor industry. From silicon-based technologies, the industry has also seen the rise of compound semiconductors, such as gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), especially in high-power and high-frequency applications.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
Semiconductor technology encompasses several engineering fundamentals, including:

- **Doping:** The process of adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductors to modify their electrical properties.
- **Photolithography:** A technique used to create patterns on semiconductor wafers, critical for the fabrication of integrated circuits.
- **Etching:** A process that removes layers from the surface of a semiconductor substrate to create microstructures.
- **Packaging:** The final stage of semiconductor manufacturing, where chips are enclosed to protect them and provide the necessary connections to circuit boards.
