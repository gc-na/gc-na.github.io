# Global Supply Chain (English)

## Definition of Global Supply Chain

A **Global Supply Chain** refers to the interconnected network of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers that operate on an international scale to deliver products and services to consumers. It encompasses the processes of sourcing raw materials, manufacturing goods, and distributing them across multiple geographical locations, thereby integrating various stakeholders from different parts of the world. The efficiency and effectiveness of a global supply chain are critical for companies seeking to optimize costs, reduce lead times, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of supply chain management has evolved significantly since the early 20th century. Initially focused on local and regional supply, globalization in the 1980s and 1990s drove a shift towards international sourcing and manufacturing. The advent of digital technologies, such as the Internet and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, revolutionized global supply chains by enabling real-time data sharing and communication among partners.

### Key Technological Advancements:

1. **Information Technology**: The development of software tools for inventory management, demand forecasting, and logistics tracking has transformed supply chain operations.
2. **Automation and Robotics**: The introduction of automation in manufacturing and warehousing has improved efficiency and reduced labor costs.
3. **Blockchain Technology**: Emerging as a means to enhance transparency and traceability within supply chains, blockchain offers immutable records of transactions.
4. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning**: These technologies are increasingly being used for predictive analytics, risk management, and optimizing supply chain processes.
