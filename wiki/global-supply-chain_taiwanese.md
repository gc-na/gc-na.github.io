# Global Supply Chain (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Global Supply Chain

The Global Supply Chain refers to the intricate network of production, processing, and distribution operations that span across multiple countries to deliver products and services to consumers. In the context of Taiwan, the Global Supply Chain plays a pivotal role in facilitating the export of high-tech products, particularly in the semiconductor and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) sectors. This interconnected system encompasses various stages, from raw material sourcing to manufacturing, assembly, and final delivery, ensuring efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan's emergence as a key player in the global supply chain can be traced back to the 1980s when the government initiated policies to promote technology-based industries. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a significant turning point, positioning Taiwan as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. Subsequent advancements in technology, such as the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), have further solidified Taiwan's role in the global supply chain.
