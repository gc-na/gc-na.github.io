# Grid-based Routing (English)

## Definition 

Grid-based routing refers to a systematic approach in electronic design automation (EDA) for the routing of interconnections in integrated circuits (ICs) and, more broadly, in various VLSI systems. It operates on a predefined grid layout, allowing for efficient pathfinding between nodes while minimizing routing congestion and optimizing overall performance. The grid serves as a reference framework that simplifies the complex problem of connecting multiple nets in densely packed semiconductor designs.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Grid-based routing has its roots in the early days of VLSI design, emerging alongside the need for efficient layout techniques as integrated circuits grew in complexity. Initially, routing was performed manually, which proved to be time-consuming and prone to errors. The advent of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the 1980s marked a significant turning point. Early EDA tools began implementing grid-based algorithms, allowing designers to automate the routing process.

Over the years, advancements in algorithms, such as the introduction of A* and Dijkstra’s algorithms, have refined grid-based routing techniques. These advancements have facilitated the development of more sophisticated EDA tools capable of handling larger and more complex designs, including multi-layer designs that are now commonplace in modern semiconductor technology.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Routing Algorithms

Grid-based routing utilizes various algorithms to determine the optimal paths for interconnections. Common algorithms include:

- **A* Algorithm:** Utilizes heuristics to find the shortest path efficiently within the grid.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Focuses on finding the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in the grid.

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

An essential aspect of grid-based routing is ensuring that the routed paths adhere to specific design rules. DRC verifies that the spacing and width of the routed lines meet the manufacturing constraints, which is critical for yield and performance.

### Layer Assignment

In multi-layer IC designs, grid-based routing must also consider layer assignment for the interconnections. This involves determining which layer of the grid will be used for each segment of the routing, which can be influenced by factors such as signal integrity and thermal management.

## Latest Trends

Recent trends in grid-based routing have focused on addressing the challenges posed by advanced fabrication technologies, such as FinFET and 3D ICs. The increasing complexity of designs, coupled with the need for efficient power management, has led to the development of new routing techniques that can adapt to varying design requirements. 

### Machine Learning Integration

Machine learning is beginning to play a role in optimizing routing performance. Techniques such as reinforcement learning are being investigated to develop adaptive routing algorithms that can learn from past designs and improve future routing efficiency.

### 3D Integrated Circuits

As 3D ICs gain traction, grid-based routing must evolve to handle vertical connections effectively. This includes the development of new routing paradigms that can accommodate the additional complexity introduced by stacked layers of circuitry.
