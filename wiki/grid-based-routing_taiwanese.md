# Grid-based Routing (Taiwanese)

Grid-based routing is a systematic approach in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design that utilizes a grid layout to optimize the routing of interconnections between various components on a semiconductor chip. This method is particularly vital in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), where efficient routing can significantly influence performance, power consumption, and area utilization.

## Definition of Grid-based Routing

Grid-based routing is defined as a technique in VLSI design that employs a grid structure to facilitate the connection of nodes (or components) within a semiconductor device. It involves the systematic placement of routing channels, allowing designers to navigate and connect multiple signal paths on a two-dimensional plane. The grid serves as a framework to minimize routing complexity, enhance signal integrity, and reduce overall congestion.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of grid-based routing emerged with the advancement of integrated circuit technology in the late 20th century as designers faced increasing challenges in managing the complexity of chip layouts. The transition from manual to automated design processes necessitated more sophisticated routing algorithms. Early implementations focused on simple grid layouts, which evolved into more complex structures with the advent of improved fabrication techniques and software tools.

Technological advancements in design automation, such as the introduction of EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools, have propelled the development of grid-based routing methods. These tools utilize various algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm, for efficient pathfinding and optimization.
