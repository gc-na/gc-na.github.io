# HDMI (English)

## Definition of HDMI

High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a proprietary audio/video interface that transmits uncompressed digital data. HDMI is widely used to connect high-definition video devices, such as televisions, projectors, and Blu-ray players, to a variety of source devices, including computers, gaming consoles, and streaming devices. The technology supports various resolutions, including standard, enhanced, and high-definition formats, and is capable of transmitting both video and audio over a single cable, simplifying connections and reducing cable clutter.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

HDMI was developed in 2002 by a consortium of major electronics manufacturers, including Sony, Philips, and Toshiba, among others. The first version, HDMI 1.0, offered a bandwidth of 4.95 Gbps and supported video resolutions up to 1080p. As technology evolved, subsequent versions introduced higher bandwidths and additional features, such as:

- **HDMI 1.3** (2006): Increased bandwidth to 10.2 Gbps and introduced support for Deep Color and x.v.Color.
- **HDMI 1.4** (2009): Added support for 4K resolution (up to 4096x2160) and Ethernet channel capabilities.
- **HDMI 2.0** (2013): Enhanced bandwidth to 18 Gbps, allowing for 4K video at 60 frames per second and improved audio formats like Dolby Atmos.
- **HDMI 2.1** (2017): Further increased bandwidth to 48 Gbps, introduced features such as Dynamic HDR, variable refresh rates (VRR), and enhanced audio return channel (eARC).

These advancements have kept HDMI relevant in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

HDMI operates based on several key technologies and engineering principles, including:

### Signal Transmission

HDMI uses a differential signaling method to transmit data, which helps minimize interference and maintain signal integrity over longer distances. The interface employs a set of twisted pairs within the cable, which reduces electromagnetic interference.

### Compression Standards

While HDMI primarily supports uncompressed video and audio, it is also compatible with compressed formats, such as Dolby Digital and DTS. This versatility allows HDMI to cater to various applications without compromising quality.

### Comparison: HDMI vs. DisplayPort

Both HDMI and DisplayPort are common digital interfaces for transmitting audio and video signals, but they have distinct differences:

| Feature                 | HDMI                           | DisplayPort                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Primary Use             | Consumer electronics           | Professional and computing     |
| Maximum Bandwidth       | 48 Gbps (HDMI 2.1)            | 80 Gbps (DisplayPort 2.0)     |
| Video Resolution        | Up to 10K                      | Up to 16K                      |
| Audio Return Channel     | Yes (eARC)                    | Yes (multi-channel audio)      |
| Cable Length            | Up to 15 meters (active cables)| Up to 15 meters (passive)     |
