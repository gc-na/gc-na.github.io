# Hierarchical Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Hierarchical Routing

Hierarchical Routing refers to a systematic approach in designing and managing communication networks and circuits where the routing process is organized in a multi-layered architecture. This method effectively reduces the complexity associated with routing by segmenting the network into manageable parts or layers. In the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems and semiconductor design, hierarchical routing is pivotal for enhancing performance, improving scalability, and minimizing power consumption.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of hierarchical routing emerged alongside the growth of large-scale integrated circuits in the 1980s when the complexity of semiconductor designs began to exceed the capabilities of flat routing techniques. Early research focused on developing algorithms that could efficiently manage the increased levels of interconnectivity required by Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). Over the decades, advancements in computational power and the introduction of sophisticated design tools have greatly enhanced the effectiveness of hierarchical routing methodologies.

### Technological Milestones
- **1980s**: Introduction of basic hierarchical routing algorithms.
- **1990s**: Development of advanced software tools that incorporate hierarchical routing into the design flow.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Related Technologies
- **Flat Routing**: In contrast to hierarchical routing, flat routing treats the entire circuit as a single layer, often leading to increased complexity and longer routing paths. While suitable for smaller designs, it becomes impractical for larger systems.
- **Global vs Local Routing**: Hierarchical routing can be segmented into global routing, which establishes paths at a macro level, and local routing, which fine-tunes these paths at a micro level.
- **Graph Theory**: Many hierarchical routing algorithms are based on graph theory, where the circuit layout is represented as a graph, and routing paths are determined through efficient traversal algorithms.

### Engineering Fundamentals
- **Interconnect Design**: The arrangement and design of interconnects are essential in hierarchical routing, with a focus on minimizing resistance and capacitance.
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Hierarchical routing must adhere to strict design rules to ensure manufacturability and functionality of the integrated circuits.
- **Floorplanning**: A crucial step in hierarchical routing involves determining the placement of components to optimize connectivity and reduce routing congestion.

## Latest Trends in Hierarchical Routing

As semiconductor technologies continue to advance, several key trends are shaping the future of hierarchical routing:

1. **Integration of AI and Machine Learning**: Algorithms that leverage AI are increasingly used for optimizing hierarchical routing paths, allowing for intelligent decision-making based on real-time data.
2. **3D Integration**: The shift towards 3D ICs has led to the need for more complex hierarchical routing strategies, as traditional methods may not suffice for the additional vertical layers.
3. **Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**: There is a growing emphasis on DFM principles in hierarchical routing to ensure that designs can be efficiently fabricated.
4. **Energy-Efficient Routing**: With rising concerns over power consumption, routing algorithms are being developed to minimize energy usage without compromising performance.
