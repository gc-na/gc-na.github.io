# High Dynamic Range (HDR) Processing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of High Dynamic Range (HDR) Processing

High Dynamic Range (HDR) Processing is a set of imaging techniques designed to enhance the dynamic range of images and videos beyond the capabilities of standard imaging technologies. It captures a broader spectrum of luminance levels, enabling the representation of both very bright and very dark areas in a single image without losing detail. This is achieved through a combination of advanced sensor technologies, sophisticated image processing algorithms, and optimized display systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of HDR can be traced back to the early 1990s, with pioneering work in computational photography and image processing. However, it was not until the advent of digital imaging that HDR gained significant traction. The introduction of high-resolution sensors and powerful processing units has been pivotal in the evolution of HDR technology. 

In the early 2000s, the development of image processing algorithms, such as tone mapping and exposure bracketing, allowed for more effective HDR image creation. As display technologies advanced, particularly with the introduction of OLED and quantum dot displays, HDR content became more widely accessible, enhancing the viewing experience across various platforms.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Image Sensors

The heart of HDR Processing lies in the image sensor technology, which can be categorized into two types: traditional CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor). CMOS sensors have gained prominence in HDR applications due to their ability to support high-speed readout and low power consumption.

### Tone Mapping

Tone mapping is a crucial algorithm in HDR Processing that transforms the wide range of luminance values captured in an HDR image into a more limited range suitable for display devices. This involves techniques such as global and local tone mapping, each offering different visual results based on the content being displayed.

### Display Technologies

HDR Processing is also heavily dependent on display technologies that can reproduce the expanded dynamic range. Technologies such as HDR10, Dolby Vision, and HLG (Hybrid Log-Gamma) are standards that dictate how HDR content is encoded and displayed, ensuring compatibility across devices.
