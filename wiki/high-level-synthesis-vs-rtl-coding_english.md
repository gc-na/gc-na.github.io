# High-Level Synthesis vs RTL Coding (English)

## Definition of High-Level Synthesis and RTL Coding

High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and Register Transfer Level (RTL) Coding are two distinct methodologies used in the design and implementation of digital circuits, particularly in the domain of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). 

- **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)** refers to the process of converting an abstract algorithmic description of a system, typically written in high-level programming languages such as C, C++, or SystemC, into a hardware representation at the register transfer level. This process involves various optimizations and transformations to generate efficient hardware designs.

- **Register Transfer Level (RTL) Coding**, on the other hand, involves writing hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL or Verilog to specify the behavior and structure of digital circuits. RTL focuses on the data flow and control between registers and the operations performed on the data, providing a lower-level abstraction compared to HLS.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution from manual circuit design to automated synthesis has been driven by the increasing complexity of digital systems. In the early days of digital design, engineers relied heavily on RTL coding, which required detailed knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture. The introduction of HDLs in the 1980s provided a more structured way to describe digital circuits, leading to faster design cycles.

The advent of High-Level Synthesis in the 1990s marked a significant leap in design methodology. HLS tools emerged to automate the conversion of high-level algorithms into hardware implementations, reducing the time and effort required for design and verification. Technological advancements in synthesis algorithms, optimization techniques, and the integration of machine learning have further enhanced the capabilities of HLS in recent years.
