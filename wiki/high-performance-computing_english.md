# High Performance Computing (English)

## Definition of High Performance Computing

High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to perform complex calculations at extremely high speeds. HPC systems are characterized by their ability to process large volumes of data and execute intricate computations that are beyond the capability of standard personal computers. These systems typically employ multiple processors, vast memory capacities, and high-speed interconnects to deliver superior performance for scientific, engineering, and business applications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of High Performance Computing can be traced back to the 1960s with the development of early supercomputers such as the CDC 6600, designed by Seymour Cray. This machine was notable for its ability to execute instructions at high speeds through the use of parallel processing techniques. As technology progressed, the introduction of vector processors in the 1970s and 1980s further enhanced computational capabilities.

The 1990s witnessed the rise of cluster computing, which involved connecting multiple standard computers to work together as a single system. This approach significantly reduced costs while increasing computational power. With the advent of multi-core processors in the early 2000s, HPC systems began to leverage parallelism at a chip level, further boosting performance. Today, HPC systems integrate advanced technologies such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to achieve unprecedented levels of performance.
