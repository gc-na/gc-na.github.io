# High-Speed Digital Design (English)

## Definition

High-Speed Digital Design refers to the methodologies and techniques employed in the design and implementation of digital circuits and systems that operate at high frequencies, typically exceeding 100 MHz. This field encompasses various aspects of digital circuit design, including signal integrity, power integrity, electromagnetic compatibility, and thermal management, to ensure reliable performance in applications demanding high data rates and low latency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of High-Speed Digital Design can be traced back to the late 20th century with the advent of integrated circuits (ICs) and the transition from bipolar to CMOS technologies. Early digital systems operated at relatively low frequencies, but as the demand for faster and more efficient devices grew, advancements in semiconductor technology accelerated.

### Milestones in High-Speed Digital Design

1. **CMOS Technology (1980s):** The introduction of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology allowed for lower power consumption and greater integration, setting the stage for high-speed applications.
2. **Gigahertz Systems (1990s):** The emergence of gigahertz (GHz) clock speeds marked a significant milestone, enabling the development of microprocessors and communication devices capable of handling higher data rates.
3. **Emergence of 3D ICs (2000s):** Three-dimensional integrated circuits began to gain traction, allowing for increased performance and reduced power consumption through vertical stacking of devices.
4. **Advanced node technologies (2010s):** The progression to smaller nodes, such as 14nm and 10nm processes, facilitated faster switching speeds and lower power dissipation.
