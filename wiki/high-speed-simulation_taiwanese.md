# High-Speed Simulation (Taiwanese)

## 定義

High-Speed Simulation refers to the advanced computational techniques used to model and analyze the behavior of electronic circuits, particularly in the context of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. This simulation encompasses various methodologies that allow engineers to predict the performance of circuits at high frequencies, thus ensuring improved efficiency, accuracy, and reliability in semiconductor design.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

High-Speed Simulation has its roots in the early development of electronic circuits, where engineers relied on traditional circuit analysis methods. However, as technology advanced and the demand for faster and more complex systems grew, the limitations of manual calculations became evident. The introduction of software tools in the 1980s, such as SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), marked a significant shift toward computer-aided design (CAD).

Over the years, advancements in algorithms, computational power, and modeling techniques have led to the emergence of high-speed simulation tools that can accurately model high-frequency behavior. These tools leverage parallel computing and machine learning techniques to enhance simulation speed and accuracy, accommodating the demands of modern semiconductor technologies.
