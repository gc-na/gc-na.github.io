# ILP-based Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of ILP-based Routing

ILP-based Routing, or Integer Linear Programming-based Routing, is a mathematical optimization method used in the field of semiconductor technology and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems to determine the optimal layout of interconnections in integrated circuits. By formulating routing problems as integer linear programs, designers can efficiently minimize the total wire length, reduce signal delay, and optimize for other critical parameters such as power consumption and manufacturing feasibility.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of ILP-based Routing can be traced back to the early days of VLSI design in the 1970s when the rapid increase in transistor density necessitated advanced techniques for circuit layout and routing. The transition from heuristic methods to mathematically rigorous approaches marked a significant advancement in the optimization of routing processes.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the adoption of ILP techniques became more prevalent due to the exponential growth of integrated circuit complexity. The introduction of powerful solvers and advanced algorithms, such as branch-and-cut and cutting-plane methods, further enhanced the practical applicability of ILP in routing tasks.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Graph Theory in Routing

At the heart of ILP-based Routing lies graph theory, which provides a framework for representing the circuit as a graph where nodes represent circuit elements and edges represent potential routing paths. This representation allows for the application of ILP formulations to optimize routing paths effectively.

### Heuristic vs. ILP-based Methods

While heuristic methods, such as maze routing and greedy algorithms, provide quick solutions to routing problems, they often lack the optimality guaranteed by ILP formulations. In contrast, ILP-based Routing, while computationally intensive, ensures the best possible solution under given constraints.
