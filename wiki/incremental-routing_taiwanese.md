# Incremental Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Incremental Routing

Incremental Routing is a specialized method in the field of VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) design that facilitates the efficient creation of interconnects in a circuit layout. This technique allows for the addition of new routing paths to an existing design without the need to completely re-route the entire circuit. It is particularly beneficial in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), where maintaining existing connections while accommodating new design requirements is critical.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Incremental Routing can be traced back to the early days of VLSI design in the 1980s when the need for more efficient design methodologies became apparent. Traditional routing techniques often required full rerouting, which was time-consuming and resource-intensive. As designs grew in complexity, researchers sought methods to streamline this process. 

The introduction of algorithms such as the A* algorithm and advancements in graph theory significantly improved the efficiency of routing. The development of CAD tools that incorporate Incremental Routing has allowed engineers to achieve faster design cycles, particularly in the context of the Taiwanese semiconductor industry, which is renowned for its rapid advancements in technology.
