# Industrial Automation (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Industrial Automation

Industrial Automation refers to the use of control systems, such as computers or robots, for handling different processes and machinery in an industry to replace human intervention. It involves the integration of various technologies such as robotics, control systems, and information technology to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and speed of production processes while reducing costs and human error.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of industrial automation can be traced back to the late 18th century with the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which marked the transition from manual labor to mechanized work. However, the real transformation in industrial automation began in the mid-20th century with the introduction of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and the development of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines. 

In Taiwan, the government has played a crucial role in fostering the semiconductor and manufacturing sectors, which have significantly advanced automation technologies. The shift from labor-intensive manufacturing to automation was accelerated in the 1990s due to globalization and competition, leading to the development of smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0 concepts.
