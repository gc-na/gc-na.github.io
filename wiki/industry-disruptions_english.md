# Industry Disruptions (English)

## Definition of Industry Disruptions

Industry disruptions refer to significant shifts in market dynamics, driven by technological advancements or innovative business models that fundamentally alter how industries operate. These disruptions can lead to the obsolescence of established products, services, or business practices, forcing companies to adapt or risk declining relevance. Technological disruptions often arise from breakthroughs in areas such as software, hardware, or manufacturing processes, leading to new market entrants challenging traditional players.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Evolution of Industry Disruptions

The concept of industry disruption has roots in the broader framework of disruptive innovation, popularized by Clayton Christensen in the 1990s. Disruptive innovations typically start at the bottom of a market, targeting underserved customers before gradually moving up and displacing established competitors. 

Historically, the advent of the Internet in the late 20th century marked a watershed moment for numerous industries. For instance, the rise of e-commerce platforms disrupted traditional retail, while streaming services transformed the entertainment landscape. More recently, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation technologies have catalyzed further disruptions across various sectors.
