# Industry Disruptions (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Industry Disruptions

Industry disruptions refer to significant changes that transform the way businesses operate within a specific sector, often driven by technological innovations or shifts in consumer preferences. In the context of Taiwan, these disruptions are particularly relevant in the semiconductor and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems sectors, where advancements can lead to the obsolescence of existing technologies, business models, or even entire markets.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan has emerged as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, primarily due to its robust ecosystem, including foundries, design houses, and a skilled workforce. The foundation for Taiwan's semiconductor industry was laid in the late 20th century, with significant investment in research and development (R&D) and the establishment of firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987.

### Technological Milestones

1. **1980s-1990s: Foundry Model Emergence**  
   The introduction of the foundry model allowed companies to focus on design while outsourcing manufacturing. This model was pivotal in propelling Taiwan to the forefront of the semiconductor industry.

2. **2000s: Advancements in VLSI Technology**  
   The shift from discrete components to VLSI technology enabled the integration of millions of transistors on a single chip, leading to smaller, faster, and more efficient devices.

3. **2010s: Adoption of Advanced Node Processes**  
   The transition to 7nm and 5nm process technologies marked a significant leap in performance and power efficiency, solidifying TSMC's position as a leader in advanced semiconductor fabrication.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Semiconductor Fabrication Techniques

The manufacturing of semiconductors involves several critical processes:

- **Photolithography**: A process that uses light to transfer geometric patterns onto a substrate.
- **Doping**: The intentional introduction of impurities into a semiconductor to modify its electrical properties.
- **Etching**: Removing layers of material to create the desired circuit patterns.

### Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) vs. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

- **ASICs**: Custom-designed chips optimized for a specific application. They are highly efficient but lack flexibility.
- **FPGAs**: Reconfigurable chips that can be programmed post-manufacturing. They offer versatility but generally consume more power and are less efficient for specific tasks.
