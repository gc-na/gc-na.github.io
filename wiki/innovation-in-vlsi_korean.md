# Innovation in VLSI (Korean)

## 정의
Innovation in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to the process of developing new techniques, methods, and technologies that enhance the design, fabrication, and functionality of integrated circuits (ICs) with a very high density of transistors. This innovation is critical for achieving higher performance, lower power consumption, and smaller form factors in electronic devices.

## 역사적 배경 및 기술 발전
VLSI technology emerged in the 1970s as a significant advancement over earlier IC technologies, allowing engineers to integrate thousands of transistors onto a single chip. The introduction of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology in the 1980s marked a turning point, as it enabled the development of low-power and high-density circuits. 

Over the decades, the industry has witnessed several notable advancements, including:
- **Moore's Law:** Coined by Gordon Moore, this observation predicts that the number of transistors on a chip would double approximately every two years, leading to exponential growth in computing power.
- **FinFET Technology:** Introduced in the 2010s, FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) technology allowed for better control of current flow and reduced power leakage, facilitating continued scaling down of transistor sizes.
