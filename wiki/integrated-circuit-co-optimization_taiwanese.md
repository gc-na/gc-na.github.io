# Integrated Circuit Co-optimization (Taiwanese)

## Definition

Integrated Circuit Co-optimization (IC Co-optimization) refers to the simultaneous optimization of various design parameters within an integrated circuit (IC) to achieve superior performance, power efficiency, and area efficiency. This process involves the harmonization of multiple levels of abstraction, such as circuit design, layout, manufacturing processes, and packaging, to maximize the overall functionality of the IC while minimizing trade-offs in performance metrics.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of IC Co-optimization emerged in the late 20th century as semiconductor technology advanced, enabling the integration of billions of transistors on a single chip. Early designs focused primarily on individual components without considering their interdependencies. However, as designs became more complex, the need for a holistic approach became evident.

Key advancements that contributed to the evolution of IC Co-optimization include:

- **Moore's Law:** The observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years, leading to increased complexity and necessitating co-optimization.
- **Design Automation Tools:** The development of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools facilitated intricate designs and allowed for better integration of various components.
- **Advanced Process Technologies:** Innovations in lithography and fabrication processes, such as Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, have enabled the production of smaller and more efficient transistors.
