# Interconnect Characterization (English)

## Definition of Interconnect Characterization

Interconnect characterization refers to the process of analyzing and validating the electrical and physical properties of interconnections in semiconductor devices and integrated circuits (ICs). This involves measuring parameters such as resistance, capacitance, inductance, and propagation delay within the interconnects, which are the conductive pathways that connect various components in a circuit. Accurate interconnect characterization is crucial for ensuring signal integrity, performance optimization, and reliability in modern VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of interconnect characterization has paralleled the rapid advancements in semiconductor technology. In the early days of IC design, simple modeling techniques sufficed, as devices operated at lower frequencies and the effects of interconnects were often negligible. However, as device dimensions shrank and operating frequencies increased, interconnect effects became significant, leading to the development of more sophisticated characterization techniques.

In the 1990s, the introduction of copper interconnects and low-k dielectrics marked a substantial leap in interconnect technology. These materials allowed for reduced resistance and capacitance, but also introduced new challenges such as electromigration and signal crosstalk. The need for accurate modeling and characterization became apparent, leading to the development of tools and methodologies that incorporate advanced simulation techniques and extraction processes.
