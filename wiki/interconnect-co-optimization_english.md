# Interconnect Co-optimization (English)

## Definition of Interconnect Co-optimization

Interconnect Co-optimization refers to the simultaneous optimization of interconnects and circuit design parameters in integrated circuits (ICs) to enhance performance metrics such as speed, power consumption, and area (PPA). This approach considers the interaction between the physical interconnect structures—such as metal layers, vias, and packaging—and the electronic circuits they serve, allowing for a holistic design methodology that addresses both electrical and physical constraints.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of interconnect co-optimization has evolved alongside advancements in semiconductor technology. Early IC designs treated interconnects as passive components, which led to inefficiencies as technology scaled down. As transistor sizes shrank below 100 nanometers, the resistive and capacitive effects of interconnects became increasingly significant, necessitating a shift toward integrated design strategies.

The introduction of advanced materials, such as copper interconnects and low-k dielectric materials, marked a significant milestone in addressing interconnect delays and power dissipation. The move from planar to three-dimensional (3D) IC architectures further compounded these challenges, leading to a greater emphasis on co-optimizing interconnect strategies with circuit design.
