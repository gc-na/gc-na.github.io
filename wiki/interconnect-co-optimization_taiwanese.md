# Interconnect Co-optimization (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Interconnect Co-optimization

Interconnect Co-optimization refers to the simultaneous optimization of interconnects and logic in integrated circuits, particularly in the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. This process involves the design and adjustment of both the electrical and physical parameters of interconnects—such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance—alongside the optimization of the circuit logic itself. The goal is to minimize delays, reduce power consumption, and enhance overall performance while maintaining manufacturing feasibility.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of interconnect co-optimization emerged in response to the growing complexity of semiconductor devices and the limitations of traditional design methodologies. As VLSI technology progressed from microchips to modern System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures, the need for more efficient interconnect designs became evident. 

Historically, interconnects were treated as secondary components in the design process. However, as the scale of integration increased, the impact of interconnect delay on overall circuit performance became significant. The advent of advanced materials, such as copper and low-k dielectrics, alongside sophisticated design tools, has facilitated the development of co-optimization techniques.
