# IoT Devices (English)

## Definition of IoT Devices

Internet of Things (IoT) devices refer to a broad category of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that enable them to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices can range from simple household items to complex industrial machinery, and they often utilize various communication protocols to facilitate interoperability, data collection, and automation.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of IoT dates back to the early 1980s when researchers began exploring ways for networked devices to communicate. However, the term "Internet of Things" was first coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999, primarily in the context of supply chain management. Over the past two decades, advancements in wireless communication technologies, miniaturization of electronic components, and the proliferation of cloud computing have significantly accelerated the development of IoT devices. Key milestones include the introduction of IPv6, which expanded the address space to accommodate billions of devices, and the rise of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) that enable long-range communication for battery-operated devices.
