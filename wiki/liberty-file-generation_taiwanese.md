# Liberty File Generation (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Liberty File Generation refers to the process of creating Liberty files, which are standardized text files used to describe the timing, power, and noise characteristics of digital cells in semiconductor design. These files are essential for Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, allowing designers to ensure that their Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs) function correctly within specified performance parameters.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The concept of Liberty file generation emerged in the early 2000s, coinciding with the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices and the demand for robust design methodologies. With the transition from static timing analysis to dynamic timing analysis, the need for accurate and comprehensive timing models became paramount. The Liberty file format was developed by Synopsys to provide a unified approach to timing, power, and noise characterization, becoming a de facto standard in the industry.

Over the years, advancements in semiconductor technology, such as the introduction of FinFETs, have necessitated updates to the Liberty format to accommodate new modeling requirements. These advancements have also led to improved algorithms for Liberty file generation, enhancing the accuracy and speed of the design process.
