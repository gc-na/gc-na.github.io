# Lithography Simulation (English)

## Definition

Lithography Simulation refers to the computational modeling and analysis of the lithographic process used in semiconductor manufacturing. It encompasses the simulation of optical, chemical, and physical phenomena involved in the transfer of circuit patterns from a photomask to a semiconductor wafer. Lithography simulation is crucial for predicting the behavior and outcomes of various lithographic techniques, such as photolithography and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, enabling the optimization of processes before actual fabrication.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of lithography date back to the late 18th century, but its application in semiconductor technology began in the early 1960s with the advent of integrated circuits. The introduction of photolithography revolutionized the manufacturing process, allowing for the precise patterning of microelectronic devices. 

Historically, lithography simulation emerged as a response to the growing complexity of semiconductor devices. Early simulations relied on simple geometrical models, but advancements in computational power and algorithms have led to the development of sophisticated tools capable of simulating various aspects of the lithography process, including optical effects, resist chemistry, and etching.

The transition from 193 nm lithography to more advanced techniques like EUV and multi-patterning has further necessitated robust lithography simulation tools. Modern simulations can accommodate complex materials, non-linear effects, and 3D structures, making them indispensable in today's semiconductor manufacturing environment.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Optical Lithography

Optical lithography uses light to project patterns onto a photoresist-coated wafer. Lithography simulation in this context often involves modeling light propagation, interference effects, and the interaction between light and photoresist materials. 

### EUV Lithography

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography operates at a wavelength of around 13.5 nm, allowing for smaller feature sizes and higher resolution. The complexity of EUV systems demands advanced simulation techniques to account for factors like mask defects and flare, which can significantly affect the final pattern quality. 

### Computational Lithography

Computational lithography integrates advanced algorithms and simulations to optimize the lithographic process. Techniques like optical proximity correction (OPC) and source mask optimization (SMO) are commonly employed to enhance the manufacturing yield and device performance.
