# Low Power Analog Design (English)

## Definition of Low Power Analog Design

Low Power Analog Design refers to the methodologies and techniques employed in the design of analog circuits that consume minimal electrical power while maintaining performance metrics suitable for their intended applications. This discipline is critical in the context of modern electronics, where the demand for energy-efficient devices is ever-growing due to sustainability concerns and the proliferation of battery-operated devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The journey of Low Power Analog Design can be traced back to the early developments in semiconductor technology during the mid-20th century. The introduction of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology in the 1970s marked a significant turning point, enabling the creation of low-power digital circuits. As the demand for portable and mobile devices surged in the early 2000s, the focus shifted towards analog components, leading to advancements in low-power techniques such as sub-threshold operation, dynamic voltage scaling, and adaptive biasing.

In the 2010s, the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) further propelled the need for efficient analog circuits, resulting in innovative approaches like mixed-signal designs that combine both analog and digital functionalities while minimizing power consumption.
