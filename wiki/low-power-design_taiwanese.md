# Low Power Design (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Low Power Design

Low Power Design refers to the methodology and engineering practices aimed at minimizing the power consumption of electronic circuits, particularly in the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. The primary objective of Low Power Design is to extend battery life in portable devices, reduce heat generation, and improve energy efficiency in a variety of applications, from consumer electronics to automotive systems.

## Historical Background

The evolution of Low Power Design can be traced back to the increasing demand for mobile devices and the subsequent need for longer battery life. Early efforts in low power electronics focused on static power reduction techniques, primarily in digital circuits. As technology advanced, methods like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) emerged. The introduction of advanced fabrication technologies, such as FinFET and SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator), has further propelled the development of Low Power Design techniques.

## Engineering Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

1. **Static Power Consumption**: This refers to the power consumed by a circuit when it is not switching. It is primarily influenced by leakage currents.
   
2. **Dynamic Power Consumption**: This is the power consumed during the active switching of transistors, determined by the capacitance of the circuit and the supply voltage.

3. **Power Gating**: A technique that turns off power to certain blocks of a chip when they are not in use, effectively reducing static power consumption.

4. **Clock Gating**: This method disables the clock signal to portions of a circuit that are not in operation, thereby reducing dynamic power consumption.

5. **Voltage Scaling**: Operating circuits at lower voltages to minimize power consumption, exploiting the quadratic relationship between voltage and power.
