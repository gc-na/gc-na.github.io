#Low Power RTL Coding (English)

## Definition of Low Power RTL Coding

Low Power RTL (Register Transfer Level) Coding refers to the methodology and techniques employed in the design of digital integrated circuits, particularly Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), with the primary goal of minimizing power consumption. It encompasses coding practices, architectural design choices, and optimization strategies that are implemented at the RTL abstraction level, where the behavior of digital systems is described in terms of data flow and the operations performed on that data.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The importance of power efficiency in electronic design has accelerated since the 1980s, with the advent of portable devices and the increasing demand for battery-operated consumer electronics. Early methods primarily focused on static power consumption, but as technologies progressed, dynamic power consumption became a critical factor due to the scaling down of transistor sizes in accordance with Moore's Law.

Significant advancements in Low Power RTL Coding have been catalyzed by the development of new semiconductor technologies, such as FinFETs and SOI (Silicon On Insulator), which offer improved performance with reduced leakage currents. Additional innovations include clock gating, multiple voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and the introduction of specialized low-power design libraries.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Low Power Design Techniques

1. **Clock Gating**: This technique involves disabling the clock signal to portions of a circuit that are not in use, thus reducing dynamic power dissipation.
  
2. **Multi-Vt (Threshold Voltage) Libraries**: By utilizing transistors with different threshold voltages, designers can optimize for performance in critical paths while using low-Vt transistors for non-critical paths to save power.

3. **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)**: This method allows the system to adjust its voltage and frequency according to the workload, thus minimizing power usage when full performance is not needed.
