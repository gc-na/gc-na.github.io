# LPDDR5 (English)

## Definition of LPDDR5

Low Power Double Data Rate 5 (LPDDR5) is a type of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) specifically designed for mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and other portable electronics. It is the fifth generation of LPDDR technology, offering enhanced performance, efficiency, and bandwidth compared to its predecessors, such as LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X. LPDDR5 operates at lower voltages and provides higher data transfer rates while minimizing power consumption, crucial for extending battery life in mobile applications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The development of LPDDR technology began in the late 2000s, with LPDDR being introduced to address the growing demand for energy-efficient memory solutions in mobile devices. The first version, LPDDR1, was released in 2009, followed by LPDDR2 in 2011 and LPDDR3 in 2013. Each subsequent generation brought improvements in speed, power efficiency, and overall performance.

LPDDR4, launched in 2014, marked a significant leap by doubling the data rates of its predecessors and introducing features such as a 32-bit data bus and increased memory density. LPDDR4X followed in 2016, further reducing power consumption while maintaining high performance.

LPDDR5 was officially announced by JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) in early 2019, bringing forth several advancements, including:

- Increased data rates up to 6400 MT/s (megatransfers per second)
- Enhanced power efficiency through lower voltage operation (1.1V)
- Improved bandwidth and support for higher memory density, facilitating applications in AI and machine learning.
