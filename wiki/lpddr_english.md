#LPDDR (English)

## Definition of LPDDR

Low Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR) is a type of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) specifically designed for mobile devices and applications that require efficient energy consumption while maintaining high-performance data transfer rates. LPDDR operates by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, effectively doubling the data rate in comparison to traditional single data rate (SDR) memory technologies.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

LPDDR technology was first introduced in the early 2000s, with LPDDR1 being released in 2005. The evolution of LPDDR has seen several significant advancements:

- **LPDDR1:** The first generation began to address the needs of mobile devices, offering lower voltage operation compared to standard DDR SDRAM. It operated at a voltage of 1.8V.
  
- **LPDDR2:** Introduced in 2010, LPDDR2 improved performance with data rates reaching up to 1066 MT/s (megatransfers per second) while reducing power consumption further to 1.5V.
  
- **LPDDR3:** Launched in 2012, LPDDR3 supported data rates of up to 2133 MT/s and continued the trend of low power consumption, operating at 1.2V. 

- **LPDDR4:** Released in 2014, LPDDR4 offered a significant leap in performance, achieving data rates of up to 4266 MT/s and voltage operation as low as 1.1V, enhancing both speed and energy efficiency.

- **LPDDR5:** The most recent iteration, LPDDR5, was standardized in 2019. It supports data rates up to 6400 MT/s and includes features such as improved bandwidth and efficiency, operating at 1.05V.
