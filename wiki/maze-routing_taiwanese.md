# Maze Routing (Taiwanese)

Maze routing is a critical technique in the field of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems design, particularly for complex integrated circuits (ICs). This article explores the definition, historical background, technological advancements, related technologies, current trends, major applications, and future directions concerning maze routing.

## Definition of Maze Routing

Maze routing is defined as an algorithmic approach used in the layout design of ICs to find the shortest path for connecting various components on a chip while avoiding obstacles. This process is akin to navigating through a maze, where the goal is to connect terminals, such as pins and pads, with minimal wire length and without violating design rules. The algorithms used in maze routing are particularly essential in the final stages of physical design, ensuring that the interconnections are optimized for performance, power consumption, and area.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
