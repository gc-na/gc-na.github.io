# Measurement Setup (English)

## Definition of Measurement Setup

A **Measurement Setup** refers to the comprehensive arrangement of instruments, components, and configurations employed to obtain accurate data and evaluate the performance of electronic devices, circuits, and systems. This setup encompasses various measurement techniques, including electrical, thermal, optical, and mechanical measurements, tailored to the specific requirements of the system under test (SUT). In semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, a measurement setup is crucial for verifying design specifications, characterizing device performance, and ensuring reliability.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Measurement setups have evolved significantly since the inception of semiconductor technology in the mid-20th century. Initially, rudimentary analog instruments were used for basic measurements. The advent of digital technology in the 1970s introduced oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and digital multimeters, which enhanced measurement precision and data analysis capabilities.

In the 1990s, the rise of VLSI technology necessitated more sophisticated measurement setups, integrating automated systems and software-based analysis tools. The introduction of high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) techniques further revolutionized measurement setups, enabling real-time data acquisition and analysis.
