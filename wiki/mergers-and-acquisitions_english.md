# Mergers and Acquisitions (English)

## Definition of Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are strategic business processes that involve the consolidation of companies or assets through various types of financial transactions. A **merger** occurs when two companies combine to form a new entity, while an **acquisition** refers to one company purchasing another and absorbing its operations. The primary objective behind M&A activities is to achieve growth, enhance operational efficiencies, gain market share, and create shareholder value.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Mergers and Acquisitions dates back to the late 19th century, during the Industrial Revolution, when companies sought to consolidate resources and eliminate competition. The 20th century witnessed several waves of M&A activity, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, driven by deregulation, globalization, and technological advancements.

Technological innovations have significantly influenced M&A strategies, especially in sectors such as telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductor technology. The rise of **Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)** and **System on Chips (SoCs)** has prompted companies to pursue acquisitions to acquire specialized technologies and expertise.
