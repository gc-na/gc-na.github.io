# Mixed-Signal Integration (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Mixed-Signal Integration

Mixed-Signal Integration refers to the incorporation of both analog and digital circuits on a single semiconductor chip. This integration enables the processing of different types of signalsâ€”analog signals, which are continuous in nature, and digital signals, which are discretized. Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits (ICs) are essential for applications that require the conversion of real-world signals into digital formats and vice versa, making them vital components in various electronic systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The development of Mixed-Signal Integration can be traced back to the early 1980s when the demand for more advanced and compact electronic devices began to rise. As semiconductor technology evolved, the push for integrating analog and digital functionalities led to significant advancements in fabrication processes. The introduction of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology played a pivotal role in enabling mixed-signal designs due to its low power consumption and high noise immunity.
