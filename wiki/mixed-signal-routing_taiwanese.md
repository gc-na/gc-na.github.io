# Mixed-Signal Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Mixed-Signal Routing

Mixed-Signal Routing refers to the design and implementation of routing strategies in integrated circuits (ICs) that handle both analog and digital signals. This involves the careful placement and interconnection of components on a semiconductor die to ensure that signals of varying characteristics coexist without interference. The primary goal of mixed-signal routing is to maintain signal integrity and minimize crosstalk, noise, and other forms of signal degradation in complex VLSI systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Mixed-Signal Routing can be traced back to the increasing demand for integrating analog functionalities with digital processing capabilities in semiconductor designs. Historically, the separation of analog and digital components in integrated circuits was a common practice. However, with the advent of technologies such as CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor), which enabled the integration of both types of signals on a single chip, the need for effective mixed-signal routing techniques became paramount.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry has experienced rapid growth, particularly in the 2000s, with companies like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) leading developments in advanced process nodes. These advancements have propelled mixed-signal routing techniques, making them essential for the design of modern Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs).
