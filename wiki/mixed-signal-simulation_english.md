# Mixed-Signal Simulation (English)

## Definition of Mixed-Signal Simulation

Mixed-signal simulation refers to the process of modeling and analyzing electronic circuits that contain both analog and digital components. This simulation is a critical aspect of the design and verification process in integrated circuits (ICs), particularly for systems that require the combination of analog functions, such as signal processing, with digital logic components. The aim of mixed-signal simulation is to ensure that the interactions between these two types of signals are accurately captured, allowing for reliable circuit performance before fabrication.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of mixed-signal simulation can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor technology in the 1960s, when the first integrated circuits began to emerge. Initially, the design of analog and digital circuits was conducted separately, often leading to integration challenges. The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools in the 1980s marked a significant milestone, allowing engineers to simulate mixed-signal systems more effectively.

In the 1990s, as the complexity of ICs increased, the development of specific mixed-signal simulation techniques, such as SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis), became crucial. SPICE provided a foundation for analyzing analog circuits, while various extensions and adaptations allowed for digital components to be incorporated. The introduction of Verilog-AMS (Analog Mixed-Signal) in the early 2000s further advanced the field, enabling a more unified approach to mixed-signal design.

Recent technological advancements have seen the rise of sophisticated simulation tools that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize the design process. These tools enhance the accuracy of simulations and reduce the time required for verification, reflecting the growing complexity of modern ICs.
