# Moore's Law (English)

## Definition of Moore's Law

Moore's Law is an empirical observation made by Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965, which posits that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to an exponential increase in computing performance and a corresponding decrease in relative cost per transistor. This observation has driven the semiconductor industry for decades, influencing both technological advancement and economic strategy.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Origins of Moore's Law

Moore's Law originated from an article published by Gordon Moore in "Electronics Magazine" in 1965, where he predicted that the density of transistors would continue to double every year. In 1975, he revised this prediction to every two years, a timeline that has largely held true over the decades. This prediction was based on the historical trends observed in semiconductor manufacturing and the pace of technological innovation.

### Advancements in Fabrication Technology

The implementation of Moore's Law has been facilitated by numerous advancements in semiconductor fabrication technologies, including:

- **Photolithography**: The process of transferring circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. Innovations in photolithography, particularly the shift to extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV), have enabled the production of smaller transistors.
  
- **Material Science**: The development of new materials, such as high-k dielectrics and metal gates, has improved transistor performance and reduced power consumption.
  
- **Device Architecture**: The evolution from planar transistors to three-dimensional structures like FinFETs (Fin Field-Effect Transistors) has allowed for increased transistor density without significant increases in power consumption.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### Scaling and Node Shrinkage

As of 2023, the semiconductor industry has reached nodes as small as 5nm, with companies pushing towards 3nm and beyond. This miniaturization allows for greater transistor density and improved power efficiency. The transition to nodes below 7nm has introduced challenges, including increased leakage currents and heat dissipation.

### Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA FET)

GAA FET technology is an emerging architecture that further improves upon FinFET designs by surrounding the channel with gates on all sides, enhancing electrostatic control over the channel and reducing short-channel effects. This innovation is critical for continuing the trend of miniaturization and performance improvement.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)

EUV lithography represents a significant step forward for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. It utilizes extremely short wavelengths of light to create intricate patterns on chips, enabling the production of smaller features and higher transistor densities while maintaining yield and cost-effectiveness.

## Major Applications

Neuromorphic computing aims to mimic the neural structures of the human brain to improve processing efficiency and reduce power consumption. Research in this area seeks to create chips that can perform AI tasks more naturally and efficiently, potentially leading to a new paradigm in computing.

### 3D Integrated Circuits (3D ICs)

The development of 3D ICs involves stacking multiple layers of circuits vertically, which can significantly increase performance and reduce the footprint of electronic devices. This technology is seen as a way to continue the trend of increasing transistor density while overcoming some of the limitations of traditional planar scaling.
