# Multi-layer Routing (English)

## Definition of Multi-layer Routing

Multi-layer routing refers to the process of connecting various components in integrated circuits (ICs) using multiple metal layers, enhancing the complexity and density of chip designs. This technique is essential in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, where the interconnection of numerous transistors, resistors, capacitors, and other circuit elements is required to form functional devices. By utilizing multiple layers for routing, designers can minimize signal interference, reduce the overall chip area, and improve performance through optimized signal paths.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of multi-layer routing emerged with the advancement of semiconductor technology in the late 20th century. Early ICs utilized single-layer metal interconnects, which limited their complexity and performance. As semiconductor fabrication technologies evolved, particularly with the introduction of photolithography techniques in the 1970s, designers started to incorporate multiple metal layers. This allowed for more sophisticated designs, improved signal integrity, and the ability to handle higher operational frequencies.

With the advent of technology nodes shrinking to the sub-10 nm scale, multi-layer routing has seen significant innovations in materials, such as low-k dielectrics and copper interconnects, which help reduce capacitance and resistive losses. Advanced tools and methodologies for routing have also developed, including machine learning algorithms that optimize routing paths and mitigate potential signal integrity issues.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
