# Multi-layer Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Multi-layer Routing

Multi-layer routing refers to a critical design methodology in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, where electronic circuits are constructed using multiple layers of conductive pathways to optimize space and performance. This technique allows for the interconnection of various components on a semiconductor chip, facilitating complex designs while minimizing signal interference and resistance.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The genesis of multi-layer routing can be traced back to the evolution of integrated circuits in the late 20th century, particularly during the transition from single-layer to multi-layer designs. With the advent of smaller transistors and increased circuit density, the necessity for efficient routing solutions became paramount. Over the years, advancements in photolithography and etching technologies have enabled the fabrication of intricate multi-layered structures, paving the way for modern semiconductor devices.

The introduction of CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools in the 1980s significantly enhanced the design process, allowing engineers to visualize and optimize routing configurations. Today, technologies such as 3D ICs (Integrated Circuits) and advanced packaging techniques further leverage multi-layer routing principles, enhancing performance metrics like power consumption and signal integrity.
