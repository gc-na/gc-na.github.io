# Nanoelectronics (English)

## Definition of Nanoelectronics
Nanoelectronics is a subfield of electronics that focuses on the application of nanotechnology to the design, fabrication, and operation of electronic components and systems at the nanoscale. This discipline encompasses devices and circuits with dimensions typically ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers, where quantum mechanical effects become significant, leading to new electronic behaviors that differ from conventional electronics. Nanoelectronics aims to exploit these unique properties to develop smaller, faster, and more efficient devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The origins of nanoelectronics can be traced back to the late 20th century, coinciding with the advent of nanotechnology in the 1980s. The invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, which allowed scientists to visualize and manipulate individual atoms, marked a significant milestone. The further development of techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) facilitated the fabrication of nanoscale devices.

In the 1990s, the miniaturization of silicon-based transistors led to the emergence of nanoscale CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology, paving the way for modern integrated circuits. The transition from micrometer-scale to nanometer-scale devices has resulted in significant advancements in semiconductor technology, allowing for increased transistor density, reduced power consumption, and enhanced performance.
