# Noise Analysis (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Noise Analysis refers to the systematic evaluation of noise characteristics in electronic circuits, particularly in semiconductor devices and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. This analysis is crucial for understanding how noise affects the performance, reliability, and efficiency of electronic components, especially in sensitive applications like communication systems and precision instrumentation.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The study of noise in electronic circuits can be traced back to the early 20th century when researchers began to understand the impact of thermal noise and shot noise on circuit performance. Significant advancements were made with the development of transistors in the 1950s, leading to the need for comprehensive noise analysis in semiconductor devices. 

In the 1970s and 1980s, the advent of integrated circuits and the increasing complexity of VLSI systems prompted a more rigorous approach to noise analysis. This era witnessed the emergence of sophisticated simulation tools and methodologies that enabled engineers to model and mitigate noise effects more effectively.

## A vs B: Noise Analysis vs Signal Integrity

Noise Analysis and Signal Integrity are closely related fields but focus on different aspects of electronic circuit design. 

- **Noise Analysis** primarily deals with the measurement and evaluation of noise sources and their impact on circuit performance. It encompasses various noise types and provides methods to analyze and mitigate these effects.

- **Signal Integrity**, on the other hand, focuses on ensuring that signals maintain their quality and integrity as they travel through circuits and systems. This involves addressing issues like signal distortion, reflection, and crosstalk, which are influenced by noise but are more concerned with the preservation of signal quality.
