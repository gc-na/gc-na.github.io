# Noise Figure Calculation (English)

## Definition of Noise Figure Calculation

Noise Figure (NF) is a key parameter in the field of electronics and telecommunications, representing the degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as it passes through a system. It quantifies how much noise a device adds to the signal it processes, allowing engineers to assess the performance of amplifiers, receivers, and other signal-processing components. Mathematically, the Noise Figure is defined as:

\[
NF = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{SNR_{in}}{SNR_{out}} \right)
\]

Where \(SNR_{in}\) is the input signal-to-noise ratio and \(SNR_{out}\) is the output signal-to-noise ratio. A lower Noise Figure indicates better performance, as it implies that the device adds less noise to the signal.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Noise Figure was first introduced in the early days of radio communication in the 1940s. Research into noise in electronic devices led to an understanding of how thermal noise, shot noise, and flicker noise affect signal integrity. The development of transistor technology in the 1950s and 1960s marked significant advancements in noise performance, leading to the creation of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) that are critical in modern communication systems.

In recent years, advancements in materials science, particularly with the emergence of graphene and other two-dimensional materials, have spurred innovations in the design of low-noise electronic devices. Moreover, the integration of digital signal processing (DSP) techniques has allowed for improved noise mitigation strategies.
