# Noise Figure Calculation (Taiwanese)

## Formal Definition of Noise Figure Calculation

Noise Figure (NF) is a critical parameter in the design and analysis of communication systems that quantifies the degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as it passes through a system or component. It is defined as the ratio of the input SNR to the output SNR, expressed in decibels (dB). Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

\[
NF = 10 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{SNR_{input}}{SNR_{output}}\right)
\]

Where \(SNR_{input}\) is the SNR at the input of the device, and \(SNR_{output}\) is the SNR at the output. A lower Noise Figure indicates better performance, as it signifies less degradation of the signal due to noise introduced by the device.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Noise Figure emerged in the early days of radio engineering, where the need for high-quality signal reception led to the development of various amplification and filtering techniques. Over the years, advancements in semiconductor technology, particularly in the development of low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and radio frequency (RF) components, have enabled engineers to achieve lower NF values. The introduction of GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) and more recently, GaN (Gallium Nitride) technologies has further pushed the boundaries of noise performance in RF applications.
