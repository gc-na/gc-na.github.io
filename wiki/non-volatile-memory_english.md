# Non-Volatile Memory (English)

## Definition of Non-Volatile Memory

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) refers to a category of computer memory that retains stored data even when not powered. Unlike volatile memory types, such as Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM), which lose their contents when power is interrupted, NVM is essential for applications that require persistent data storage. The most common forms of NVM include Flash memory, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), and Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Non-Volatile Memory can be traced back to the early days of computing when magnetic core memory was used in the 1950s and 1960s. The introduction of EEPROM in the 1970s marked a significant advancement, allowing data to be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The development of Flash memory in the late 1980s by Toshiba revolutionized the NVM landscape, enabling higher storage densities and faster access times.

In the 21st century, NVM technology has continued to progress, with advancements such as 3D NAND Flash and emerging NVM technologies like Phase Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive RAM (ReRAM). These innovations have facilitated the growing demand for high-capacity, low-latency storage solutions in various applications.
