# Nonlinear Device Modeling (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Nonlinear Device Modeling is defined as the mathematical representation and simulation of semiconductor devices that exhibit nonlinear behavior under varying electrical conditions. Unlike linear models, which assume proportionality between voltage and current, nonlinear device models account for complex phenomena such as capacitance variation, threshold voltage changes, and saturation effects, making them essential for accurately predicting the performance of modern electronic circuits.
