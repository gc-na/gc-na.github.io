# NOR Flash (English)

## Definition of NOR Flash

NOR Flash is a type of non-volatile memory technology that allows data to be electrically erased and reprogrammed. NOR Flash memory is structured such that each memory cell consists of a floating-gate transistor, organized in a way that allows for random access to individual cells. This structure enables NOR Flash to support both code storage and execution in a manner similar to traditional SRAM, making it particularly useful in applications that require fast read speeds and low latency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of NOR Flash can be traced back to the 1980s, when the need for a compact, efficient memory solution for embedded systems became prominent. NOR Flash was developed as an evolution of earlier EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) technologies, offering significant improvements in speed, density, and reusability. The introduction of floating-gate transistors was crucial in enhancing the scalability and performance of NOR Flash devices.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, advancements in fabrication techniques, such as the introduction of smaller process nodes and multi-level cell (MLC) designs, allowed for increased storage capacity and reduced costs. The shift towards smaller geometries, particularly in the sub-100nm range, has been pivotal in making NOR Flash a common choice for a variety of electronic devices.

## Engineering Fundamentals

### Structure of NOR Flash

NOR Flash memory is characterized by a parallel architecture, consisting of an array of memory cells connected to bit lines and word lines. Each cell can be accessed independently, which allows for fast random access, making NOR Flash ideal for executing instructions directly from memory.

#### Memory Cell Design

The basic memory cell in NOR Flash utilizes a floating-gate transistor, where the gate is isolated by an insulating layer. This design allows for the storage of charge, representing binary information. The writing and erasing processes involve tunneling electrons into or out of the floating gate, enabling data modification.
