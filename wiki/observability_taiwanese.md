# Observability (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Observability

Observability, in the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, refers to the ability to measure and analyze the internal states of a system by observing its external outputs. In VLSI design, observability is a critical feature that enables engineers to verify and debug the functionality of complex integrated circuits (ICs) and systems-on-chip (SoCs). It plays a vital role in both the design verification phase and post-silicon validation, ensuring that the system behaves as intended under various conditions.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of observability has roots in control theory, where it was initially utilized to assess the internal states of dynamic systems. As semiconductor technology advanced through the 20th century, the need for effective testing and debugging methodologies became apparent. The introduction of technologies such as built-in self-test (BIST) and scan chains in the 1980s revolutionized observability by allowing easier access to internal circuit nodes, facilitating efficient fault detection and diagnosis.

Recent advancements have focused on integrating observability features directly into the design process, such as the use of advanced debugging tools and methodologies that leverage machine learning algorithms to predict failure modes and optimize test coverage.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Built-In Self-Test (BIST)

BIST is a prominent technique used to enhance observability by embedding test circuitry within a chip. It allows for automatic testing of the integrated circuit without the need for external test equipment. This self-testing capability improves both reliability and accessibility during production and field operations.

### Scan Chain

Scan chains are another crucial technology that facilitate observability by converting sequential elements within a design into a serial chain. This architecture allows engineers to shift in test data and observe internal states more easily, thus simplifying the debugging process.

### Design for Testability (DFT)

DFT techniques are employed to design systems in a way that makes them easier to test and debug. This involves incorporating additional structures and methodologies that enhance observability and controllability, ensuring that faults can be detected during the testing phase.
