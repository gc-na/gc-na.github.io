# On-Cell Touch Integration (Taiwanese)

## Definition of On-Cell Touch Integration

On-Cell Touch Integration (OCTI) refers to a technology in display manufacturing that integrates touch sensing functionality directly onto the display's substrate, typically within the liquid crystal display (LCD) or organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels. Unlike traditional touch technologies, which use external touch sensors, OCTI embeds touch electrodes within the display layer itself, allowing for a more streamlined design, improved optical clarity, and reduced manufacturing costs.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The development of On-Cell Touch Integration can be traced back to the early 2000s, when the demand for thinner and lighter devices surged. As smartphones and tablets began to dominate the market, manufacturers sought ways to enhance display performance while minimizing space and weight. The introduction of On-Cell technology marked a significant advancement over earlier methods like In-Cell and traditional external touch technologies.
