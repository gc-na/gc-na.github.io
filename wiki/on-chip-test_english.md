# On-Chip Test (English)

## Definition of On-Chip Test
On-Chip Test (OCT) refers to a suite of methodologies and technologies employed to verify the functionality, performance, and reliability of integrated circuits (ICs) during the production process. This testing occurs directly on the chip itself, as opposed to external testing methods, and is critical for ensuring that Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and other VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) systems operate as intended before they are deployed in real-world applications. The primary goal of on-chip testing is to identify defects, minimize manufacturing costs, and enhance the overall quality of semiconductor devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of on-chip testing has evolved significantly since the 1970s when semiconductor technology began to mature. Early testing methods relied heavily on external testing equipment, which often resulted in increased costs and time delays. As semiconductor technology advanced, particularly with the introduction of VLSI, the need for more compact and efficient test solutions became apparent.

In the 1990s, innovations such as Built-In Self-Test (BIST) emerged, allowing circuits to test themselves, thereby reducing the reliance on external test equipment. BIST techniques leverage hardware and software to generate test patterns, monitor outputs, and assess performance metrics, making on-chip testing more efficient.

Recent advancements have focused on integrating sophisticated testing mechanisms directly into the IC design. These include Design for Testability (DFT) strategies, which enhance the testability of circuits during the design phase, and the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze test data more effectively.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
### Built-In Self-Test (BIST)
BIST is a key technique in on-chip testing that allows an integrated circuit to execute its own tests. By embedding test logic within the chip, BIST can autonomously generate test patterns, apply them to the circuit under test (CUT), and evaluate the output against expected results. This not only reduces the need for external testing equipment but also accelerates the testing process.

### Design for Testability (DFT)
DFT encompasses a range of design practices that facilitate easier testing of ICs. Techniques such as scan chains, boundary scan, and test point insertion are integral to DFT, allowing for more straightforward fault detection and isolation.

### Digital vs. Analog Testing
On-chip testing can be classified into digital and analog testing. Digital testing focuses on verifying binary states and logic functions, whereas analog testing addresses continuous signals and performance parameters, such as gain, frequency response, and noise characteristics. The complexity of analog testing often necessitates more advanced techniques compared to digital testing.
