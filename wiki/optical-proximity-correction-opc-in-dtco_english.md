# Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) in DTCO (English)

## Definition of Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) in DTCO

Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) is a sophisticated computational technique employed in photolithography to enhance the accuracy of pattern transfer from photomasks to semiconductor wafers. In the context of Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO), OPC plays a critical role in addressing the challenges posed by the diffraction of light during the lithographic process, thereby enabling the manufacture of high-resolution features essential for advanced semiconductor devices.

OPC involves modifying the geometric shapes of mask patterns to compensate for distortions that occur during the imaging process. By strategically adjusting the widths, spacings, and shapes of features on the mask, OPC ensures that the desired dimensions and profiles are accurately reproduced on the wafer. This correction is particularly vital as device geometries shrink below the resolution limits of conventional lithography.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Optical Proximity Correction emerged in the 1990s as the semiconductor industry began facing challenges associated with continued scaling of device dimensions as dictated by Moore's Law. Early implementations of OPC focused on simple corrections such as biasing and linear adjustments. However, advancements in computational lithography, including the development of sophisticated algorithms and simulation tools, have significantly enhanced the capabilities of OPC.

Technological advancements in OPC have paralleled improvements in lithographic tools, including the transition from deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. These developments have allowed for the correction of more complex distortions, enabling the production of integrated circuits with feature sizes approaching 3 nanometers.
