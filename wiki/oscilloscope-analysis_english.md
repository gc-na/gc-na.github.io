# Oscilloscope Analysis (English)

## Definition of Oscilloscope Analysis

Oscilloscope Analysis refers to the systematic examination and interpretation of waveforms displayed on an oscilloscope, an electronic instrument used to visualize and measure varying signal voltages. Oscilloscopes serve as critical tools in both analog and digital electronics, allowing engineers and researchers to observe the behavior of electronic signals over time. This analysis enables the evaluation of signal properties such as amplitude, frequency, rise time, and distortion, which are instrumental in diagnosing issues in electronic circuits and systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The invention of the oscilloscope dates back to the late 19th century, with the development of the cathode ray tube (CRT) as a foundational technology. The first electronic oscilloscopes emerged in the 1920s, providing engineers with unprecedented capabilities in visualizing electrical signals. Over the decades, oscilloscopes have evolved significantly, transitioning from analog CRT designs to modern digital oscilloscopes that leverage advanced signal processing techniques.

The introduction of digital storage oscilloscopes (DSOs) in the 1980s marked a significant technological advancement, allowing for the capture and analysis of transient signals. Today, oscilloscopes are equipped with features like high bandwidth, deep memory, and advanced triggering options, enabling detailed analysis of high-speed signals.
