#Parallel Simulation (English)

## Definition of Parallel Simulation
Parallel Simulation refers to a computational framework where multiple simulation processes are executed simultaneously across multiple computing resources. This approach enables the faster execution of complex simulations by dividing tasks into smaller, independent units that can be processed concurrently, utilizing the power of multicore processors, clusters, or cloud-based resources. This technique is particularly useful in domains requiring large-scale simulations, such as semiconductor design, fluid dynamics, and system-level modeling.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The concept of parallel simulation emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, during which advancements in computer architecture and the development of parallel computing paradigms began to take shape. Early implementations primarily focused on distributed computing systems, where multiple computers worked together to solve a single problem. The advent of shared-memory architectures and the introduction of parallel programming models such as MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP significantly enhanced the capabilities of parallel simulations.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the explosion of computational power through the development of multicore processors and high-performance computing (HPC) environments further fueled advancements in parallel simulation methodologies. In recent years, the integration of graphics processing units (GPUs) and cloud computing has transformed the landscape, enabling real-time simulations and on-demand computational resources.
