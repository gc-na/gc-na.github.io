# Parallelism in RTL (Korean)

## 정의

Parallelism in RTL (Register Transfer Level) refers to the ability to execute multiple operations simultaneously within a digital circuit design. This concept is crucial in optimizing performance and improving the efficiency of hardware designs, particularly in the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. Parallelism allows for the concurrent execution of different tasks, which can significantly enhance throughput and reduce latency in processing.

## 역사적 배경 및 기술적 발전

Parallelism in RTL has evolved significantly since the early days of digital design. Initially, circuits were designed using sequential logic, where operations were performed one after another. However, as the demand for higher performance grew with the advent of modern computing, designers began to explore parallel architectures.

The introduction of VLSI technology in the 1970s marked a turning point. Designers leveraged the growing number of transistors available on a single chip to implement parallel processing capabilities. Technologies like pipelining and superscalar architectures emerged, allowing multiple instructions to be processed simultaneously, thereby laying the groundwork for modern parallelism in RTL.
