# Parasitic Extraction (English)

## Definition of Parasitic Extraction

Parasitic extraction is a critical process in the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs) that involves the identification and quantification of parasitic elements—such as capacitance, resistance, and inductance—arising from the physical layout of circuit components. These parasitic elements can significantly affect circuit performance, including speed, power consumption, and signal integrity. The primary goal of parasitic extraction is to accurately model these parasitics to enhance the reliability and functionality of electronic systems, particularly in complex designs such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of parasitic extraction emerged alongside the evolution of semiconductor technology in the mid-20th century. Early integrated circuits were relatively simple and could tolerate the effects of parasitics. However, as technology advanced and the demand for higher performance and miniaturization increased, the impact of parasitic elements became more pronounced. 

In the 1980s, the advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools revolutionized the extraction process, allowing engineers to simulate and analyze parasitics more effectively. Techniques such as two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) modeling emerged, enabling more accurate extraction methods. The introduction of advanced lithography techniques, including Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV), has further propelled the need for refined parasitic extraction methodologies due to the scaling of devices to sub-5nm nodes.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### Advanced Process Nodes

With the transition to advanced technology nodes, such as 5nm and below, the complexity of parasitic extraction has increased exponentially. As devices shrink, the ratio of parasitic elements to active components rises, necessitating more sophisticated extraction tools that can handle intricate layouts and 3D structures.

### Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA FET)

The emergence of GAA FET technology represents a significant advancement in transistor architecture, allowing for better electrostatic control and reduced short-channel effects. Parasitic extraction for GAA FETs requires new algorithms and modeling techniques, as the three-dimensional nature of these devices introduces unique parasitic characteristics.

### Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)

EUV lithography has become a cornerstone technology in semiconductor manufacturing, enabling the fabrication of smaller and more complex devices. However, it also introduces new challenges in parasitic extraction due to the intricate patterns and features generated. Accurate modeling of the resulting parasitic capacitance and resistance is essential for optimizing the performance of EUV-manufactured chips.

## Major Applications

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Parasitic extraction plays a vital role in designing AI accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), where performance and efficiency are paramount. The accurate modeling of parasitics ensures that these systems can handle extensive computations without significant latency or power loss.

### Networking

In high-speed networking applications, such as data centers and 5G networks, parasitic extraction is crucial for maintaining signal integrity and minimizing latency. The optimization of parasitics can lead to enhanced data throughput and reduced error rates in communication systems.

### Computing

Modern computing systems, including personal computers and servers, rely on effective parasitic extraction to optimize the performance of CPUs and memory interfaces. With the increasing demand for speed and efficiency in computing, the importance of accurate parasitic modeling cannot be overstated.

### Automotive

The automotive industry, particularly with the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technologies, requires reliable and efficient semiconductor components. Parasitic extraction is essential for ensuring the performance and safety of electronic control units (ECUs) and sensor systems in automotive applications.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions

Current research in parasitic extraction focuses on improving accuracy and speed through the development of advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques. As IC designs grow more complex, the integration of artificial intelligence in parasitic extraction tools is becoming increasingly prevalent. 

Furthermore, researchers are exploring the impact of emerging materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), on parasitic behavior. The future of parasitic extraction also involves enhancing co-design methodologies that seamlessly integrate circuit design and manufacturing processes, ensuring that parasitics are accounted for from the very beginning of the design cycle.
