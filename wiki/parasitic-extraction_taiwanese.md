# Parasitic Extraction (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Parasitic Extraction

Parasitic Extraction is a critical process in the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs), specifically within the realms of semiconductor technology and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It involves the identification and quantification of parasitic components—such as capacitance, resistance, and inductance—that are unintentionally introduced into a circuit layout. These parasitic elements can significantly affect the performance, speed, and power consumption of ICs. The extraction process is typically performed using specialized software tools that analyze the physical layout of the circuit and the materials used in the fabrication process.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Parasitic extraction has evolved alongside the semiconductor industry. In the early days of IC design, engineers relied on manual calculations and simplistic models to estimate parasitic effects. However, as technology advanced and integrated circuits became more complex, the need for accurate parasitic extraction methods grew.

The introduction of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the 1980s marked a significant turning point. These tools automated the extraction process, allowing for the incorporation of sophisticated algorithms that could model parasitic effects more accurately. Over the years, advancements in simulation techniques and modeling have led to the development of more robust extraction tools that can perform real-time analysis and offer insights into the electrical behavior of circuits prior to fabrication.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Circuit Simulation

Circuit simulation is a complementary process to parasitic extraction. While parasitic extraction quantifies the unwanted elements within a circuit, circuit simulation analyzes the overall performance of the circuit, including both intended components and parasitic elements. Tools like SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) are widely used to simulate circuit behavior, allowing designers to predict how the circuit will perform under various conditions.

### Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)

LVS is another critical process that ensures the layout of the circuit matches the intended schematic design. While LVS focuses on verifying connectivity and logical correctness, parasitic extraction provides insights into the physical characteristics of the layout, highlighting how parasitic elements can affect performance.
