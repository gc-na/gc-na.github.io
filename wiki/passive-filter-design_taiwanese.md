# Passive Filter Design (Taiwanese)

## 定義 (Definition)

Passive Filter Design refers to the process of creating electronic filters that utilize passive components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Unlike active filters, which require an external power source and incorporate amplifying elements like Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps), passive filters do not add energy to the signal and are characterized by their inherent frequency-dependent behavior. These filters are crucial in various applications, including signal processing, audio electronics, and telecommunications.

## 歷史背景與技術進展 (Historical Background and Technological Advancements)

The concept of filtering signals dates back to the early 20th century, as engineers began to explore the effects of signal distortion and noise. The development of passive filters gained momentum with advancements in telecommunications and audio engineering. Notable milestones include the invention of the LC filter by Harold Stephen Black in 1927 and the subsequent introduction of RLC circuits.

The latter half of the 20th century saw significant technological advancements, including the miniaturization of components and the advent of integrated circuit (IC) technology. These developments allowed for more compact and efficient passive filter designs while maintaining high performance in applications such as RF communication and audio processing.

### 過濾器類型 (Types of Filters)

Passive filters can be categorized based on their frequency response:

- **Low-Pass Filter**: Allows signals below a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.
- **High-Pass Filter**: Allows signals above a certain cutoff frequency to pass while attenuating lower frequencies.
- **Band-Pass Filter**: Allows signals within a specific frequency range to pass while attenuating frequencies outside this band.
- **Band-Stop Filter**: Rejects signals within a specific frequency range while allowing others to pass.
