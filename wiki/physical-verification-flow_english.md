# Physical Verification Flow (English)

## Definition

Physical Verification Flow refers to a systematic process employed in the design of integrated circuits (ICs) to ensure that the physical layout of the chip adheres to the design rules specified by the semiconductor fabrication process. This verification ensures that the designed layout can be successfully manufactured without defects, thereby ensuring functionality and performance. The flow typically encompasses various verification steps, including Design Rule Checking (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and Electrical Rule Checking (ERC).

## Historical Background

The advent of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology in the late 20th century marked a significant milestone in semiconductor design, necessitating rigorous physical verification techniques. Early verification methods primarily focused on manual checks, which were time-consuming and prone to human error. The introduction of automated tools in the 1980s revolutionized the field, enabling designers to validate complex layouts efficiently. With the continuous miniaturization of transistors and the growing complexity of designs, the importance of an effective Physical Verification Flow has become even more pronounced.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

Design Rule Checking is a critical component of the Physical Verification Flow that ensures the layout complies with predefined design rules, such as spacing, width, and area. DRC tools analyze the geometrical properties of the layout to detect violations that could lead to manufacturing defects.

### Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)

Layout Versus Schematic verification checks that the physical representation of the circuit (the layout) corresponds accurately to the intended electronic design (the schematic). This step is essential to confirm that all connections and device parameters match the design specifications.

### Electrical Rule Checking (ERC)

Electrical Rule Checking focuses on identifying electrical issues in the layout that could affect performance, such as capacitance, resistance, and current density. ERC tools ensure that the design operates within its specified electrical limits.
