# Pixel Driving (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Pixel Driving

Pixel Driving refers to the process of controlling the individual pixels in a display to render images and graphics accurately. This technology is crucial in various display types, including Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs), Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLEDs), and MicroLED displays. Pixel driving encompasses the methods and techniques used to illuminate each pixel in accordance with the input data, ensuring that the resulting image is vibrant, sharp, and true to the source material.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of pixel driving technology can be traced back to the early days of cathode ray tube (CRT) displays. With the advent of LCD technology in the late 20th century, pixel driving mechanisms became more complex and sophisticated. The introduction of Active Matrix technology in the 1980s marked a significant advancement, allowing for higher resolutions and better color accuracy. 

In recent years, the development of OLED and MicroLED technologies has further transformed pixel driving mechanisms, leading to improvements in power efficiency, response times, and overall display quality. Innovations such as pixel-level dimming and advanced driving algorithms have also enhanced the performance of modern displays.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Display Technologies

1. **LCD vs OLED:**
   - **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):** Utilizes a backlight and liquid crystals to control light passage. Pixel driving in LCDs typically involves a thin-film transistor (TFT) array that activates individual pixels.
   - **OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode):** Each pixel emits its own light, allowing for deeper blacks and higher contrast ratios. Pixel driving in OLEDs can be more straightforward, as it doesnâ€™t require a backlight.

2. **MicroLED:**
   - MicroLED technology combines the benefits of OLED and LCD, offering self-emissive properties while maintaining high brightness and low power consumption. Pixel driving in MicroLED displays involves controlling thousands of tiny LEDs independently.

### Engineering Fundamentals

Pixel driving relies on several key engineering principles:
- **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):** This method allows multiple pixels to be activated in rapid succession, creating the illusion of continuous images.
- **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM):** A technique used in dimming pixels by varying the width of the pulses that control pixel illumination.
- **Gamma Correction:** A non-linear operation that adjusts the brightness levels of pixels to ensure that the displayed image appears natural to human vision.
