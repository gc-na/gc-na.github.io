# Placement Optimization (English)

## Definition of Placement Optimization

Placement optimization refers to the process of determining the most efficient position for components on an integrated circuit (IC) layout, particularly in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The goal of placement optimization is to minimize various metrics such as wirelength, power consumption, and signal delay while ensuring compliance with design rules and constraints. This optimization process is crucial in achieving high performance and low power consumption in modern VLSI (Very Large Scale
