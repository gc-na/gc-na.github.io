# Post-routing DRC/LVS (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Post-routing DRC/LVS

Post-routing Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) are critical verification processes employed in the design of semiconductor devices, particularly in the context of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) systems. Post-routing DRC refers to the verification of the physical layout of a circuit against a set of design rules, ensuring that the fabricated circuit will function correctly and meet performance specifications. LVS, on the other hand, checks that the layout accurately represents the intended schematic, confirming that all connections and components are correctly positioned and represented.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of DRC and LVS can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuit design, where manual checks were common. As technology progressed, the complexity of designs increased, necessitating automated verification tools. The emergence of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools in the 1980s revolutionized the semiconductor industry, allowing for efficient and accurate layout verification. Taiwan, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, has significantly contributed to the development and optimization of these processes, integrating advanced technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence into DRC/LVS tools.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### DRC Fundamentals

Design Rule Check involves a series of checks that ensure the geometrical layout adheres to specific manufacturing rules. Key factors include:

- **Spacing Rules**: Minimum distances between features to prevent electrical shorts.
- **Width Rules**: Minimum widths for lines and shapes to ensure reliability in fabrication.
- **Layer-specific Rules**: Each layer in a multi-layered design has its own set of rules.

### LVS Fundamentals

Layout Versus Schematic checks primarily focus on:

- **Connectivity Verification**: Ensures that all nodes in the layout correspond to the schematic.
- **Device Matching**: Confirms that the layout devices match the intended schematic devices in type and size.
