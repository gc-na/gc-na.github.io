# Post-Simulation Analysis (English)

## Definition of Post-Simulation Analysis

Post-Simulation Analysis (PSA) refers to the process of evaluating and interpreting the results obtained from simulation models, particularly in the context of semiconductor design and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. The primary objective of PSA is to ensure that the design meets the required specifications and performance metrics by analyzing various parameters such as power consumption, timing, signal integrity, and reliability after the simulation phase of the design cycle.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Post-Simulation Analysis emerged in tandem with the development of simulation tools for electronic design automation (EDA) in the late 20th century. Initially, simulation was primarily used for verifying circuit functionality, but as the complexity of semiconductor devices increased, especially with the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), the need for comprehensive analysis post-simulation became paramount.

The evolution of PSA has been significantly influenced by advancements in EDA tools, which have integrated sophisticated algorithms for analyzing various physical and electrical properties of semiconductor designs. Notable developments include the introduction of static timing analysis (STA) tools, signal integrity analysis tools, and thermal analysis software, which have all contributed to enhancing the accuracy and reliability of PSA.
