# Post-Simulation Analysis (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Post-Simulation Analysis

Post-Simulation Analysis refers to the process of evaluating and interpreting the results of simulation models used in various stages of the semiconductor design workflow. This analysis is critical for validating the design specifications, ensuring performance expectations, and identifying potential issues before fabrication. In the context of VLSI systems, Post-Simulation Analysis encompasses a variety of methodologies, including statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis, and performance optimization techniques.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Historically, Post-Simulation Analysis emerged alongside the development of semiconductor technology and VLSI systems in the late 20th century. As integrated circuits became more complex, the need for rigorous testing and validation methods increased. Early methods primarily focused on static timing analysis and functional verification. However, as design complexities grew, so did the sophistication of Post-Simulation Analysis techniques.

Advancements in computing power and simulation software have enabled engineers to conduct more in-depth analyses, incorporating machine learning algorithms and AI-based tools. This evolution has allowed for faster and more accurate predictions of circuit behavior under various operating conditions.
