# Power-Aware DFT (English)

## Definition of Power-Aware DFT

Power-Aware Design for Testability (DFT) refers to a collection of methodologies and techniques integrated into the design process of electronic systems, particularly in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), to ensure that the power consumption during testing is minimized. The primary goal of Power-Aware DFT is to enable efficient testing while maintaining or reducing overall power usage, thereby addressing the challenges associated with power dissipation in modern semiconductor devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The semiconductor industry has witnessed a significant evolution in DFT techniques since the early 1980s, primarily driven by the increasing complexity of integrated circuits. Initially, traditional DFT methods focused on enhancing fault coverage and improving testability without considering power constraints. However, as the demand for low-power electronics surged with the advent of mobile devices, IoT, and consumer electronics, the need for Power-Aware DFT became pronounced.

In the late 1990s, researchers began to explore techniques that integrate power management with DFT, leading to the development of methodologies such as scan chain reordering and the incorporation of power gating strategies. Over the past two decades, advancements in machine learning and AI have further enabled the optimization of DFT processes, allowing for dynamic adjustment of test patterns based on power consumption metrics.
