# Power Grid Routing (English)

## Definition of Power Grid Routing
Power Grid Routing is a critical aspect of VLSI design, specifically focused on the optimization of the power delivery network (PDN) within integrated circuits (ICs). It involves the strategic placement and routing of power and ground lines in a circuit layout to ensure that voltage levels remain stable and sufficient across all components, while minimizing power loss and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Effective power grid routing is essential for the performance, reliability, and longevity of modern electronic devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The evolution of Power Grid Routing can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuit design, where designers manually routed power lines. As IC complexity increased with the advent of technologies like Moore's Law, automated routing algorithms were developed. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the introduction of sophisticated Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools revolutionized power grid routing.

Recent advancements have included the integration of machine learning algorithms to optimize power distribution, as well as the use of 3D IC technology to enhance power delivery. The shift to FinFET and other advanced semiconductor technologies has also necessitated new routing techniques to address high power density and thermal management issues.

## Engineering Fundamentals Related to Power Grid Routing
### Power Delivery Network (PDN)
A PDN is a network of power and ground connections that supply power to the different functional blocks of an IC. An effective PDN ensures a stable supply voltage and mitigates noise, which can adversely affect circuit performance.

### Voltage Drop and IR Drop
Voltage drop, particularly IR drop, is a significant concern in power grid routing. IR drop refers to the voltage loss that occurs when current flows through resistive elements in the power delivery network. Effective routing must minimize this drop to ensure that all components receive adequate voltage.

### Parasitic Inductance and Capacitance
Parasitic elements, including inductance and capacitance, can complicate power grid routing. Inductance can lead to unwanted oscillations, while capacitance can affect the transient response of the power grid. Designers must account for these parasitics to achieve optimal performance.

## Latest Trends in Power Grid Routing
### Machine Learning and AI Integration
Recent trends in power grid routing involve the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize routing patterns, enhancing overall efficiency and performance.

### 3D IC Power Routing
With the increasing adoption of 3D integrated circuits, power grid routing has evolved to accommodate multiple layers of power and ground connections. This trend allows for improved performance and density in modern devices.

### Green Technologies
As sustainability becomes a key focus in semiconductor design, power grid routing techniques are being developed to minimize power consumption and improve energy efficiency. This includes the implementation of low-power design practices and the use of renewable energy sources in power delivery.
