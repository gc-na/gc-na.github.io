# Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) (English)

## Definition of Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)

Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) is a critical performance metric in electronic circuits, particularly in analog and mixed-signal design. It quantifies the ability of an electronic circuit, such as a voltage amplifier or an operational amplifier, to suppress variations in its power supply voltage. Formally, PSRR is defined as the ratio of the change in power supply voltage to the change in output voltage, expressed in decibels (dB):

\[
\text{PSRR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\Delta V_{PS}}{\Delta V_{OUT}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta V_{PS} \) is the change in power supply voltage.
- \( \Delta V_{OUT} \) is the change in output voltage.

A higher PSRR value indicates better performance in rejecting fluctuations in the power supply, making it paramount for applications requiring high precision and stability.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of PSRR has evolved alongside advancements in semiconductor technology. In the early days of analog electronics, the focus was primarily on voltage levels and gain. However, as devices became more sensitive and noise-prone, the need to mitigate power supply noise became apparent. 

The introduction of integrated circuits (ICs) in the 1960s revolutionized this field, leading to the development of Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps) with improved PSRR characteristics. The integration of feedback mechanisms and the use of advanced materials have further enhanced PSRR in modern devices. Notably, advancements in CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology have significantly improved the PSRR of analog components, facilitating their use in a broader range of applications.
