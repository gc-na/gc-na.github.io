#Process Integration (English)

## Definition of Process Integration

Process integration in semiconductor technology refers to the systematic combination of various manufacturing processes that are employed to fabricate integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor devices. This integration aims to optimize the performance, yield, and cost-effectiveness of semiconductor devices by ensuring that the various steps in the manufacturing process are harmonized and can be executed efficiently.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of process integration can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor manufacturing in the 1960s when the first transistors were fabricated on silicon substrates. As the demand for more complex and compact devices grew, the industry transitioned from discrete components to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and later to System on Chip (SoC) designs. 

With the advent of Moore's Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a chip approximately every two years, process integration has become increasingly crucial. The introduction of advanced technologies such as photolithography, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD) has enabled the scaling down of device features while improving performance and reducing power consumption.
