# Process Integration (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Process Integration

Process Integration refers to the comprehensive approach of managing and optimizing the various fabrication processes involved in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices. This includes the coordination of different process steps, such as lithography, etching, doping, and chemical vapor deposition, to ensure that each step contributes effectively to the final device performance, yield, and cost-efficiency. In essence, Process Integration aims to achieve a seamless interaction among multiple processes to enhance device reliability and functionality.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Early Developments

The concept of Process Integration emerged in the late 20th century, coinciding with the rapid advancements in semiconductor technology. As the demand for smaller, faster, and more efficient devices increased, the need for more sophisticated integration strategies became apparent. Taiwan's semiconductor industry began to flourish in the 1980s, laying the groundwork for its status as a global leader in Process Integration.

### Technological Milestones

Significant milestones in Process Integration include the transition from planar to three-dimensional architectures, such as FinFET and Gate-All-Around (GAA) technologies. These advancements have facilitated the scaling down of devices while improving power efficiency and performance. Moreover, the integration of advanced materials, such as high-k dielectrics and metal gates, has revolutionized transistor design and fabrication.
