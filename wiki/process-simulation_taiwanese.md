#Process Simulation (Taiwanese)

## 定義
Process Simulation is a computational technique used in semiconductor manufacturing to model and predict the behavior of various processes involved in the fabrication of integrated circuits. It allows engineers to understand how different fabrication steps, such as doping, etching, and deposition, affect the final characteristics of semiconductor devices. By simulating these processes, engineers can optimize designs, reduce costs, and improve yield.

## 歷史背景與技術進步
The origins of process simulation can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor fabrication in the 1960s when engineers began developing rudimentary tools to predict the outcomes of various manufacturing techniques. With the advent of more sophisticated computational methods and the increasing complexity of integrated circuits, process simulation evolved substantially. The introduction of Monte Carlo methods, finite element analysis, and other numerical techniques during the 1980s and 1990s significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of these simulations.

As technology progressed, the development of software tools such as Sentaurus, Synopsys, and Silvaco Advanced Modeling Platform allowed engineers to perform complex simulations that incorporate various physical phenomena, including quantum effects and thermal dynamics.
