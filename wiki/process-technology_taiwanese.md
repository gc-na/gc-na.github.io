# Process Technology (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Process Technology, or manufacturing technology, refers to the series of techniques and methodologies used in the fabrication and production of semiconductor devices. This encompasses a variety of processes, including photolithography, etching, doping, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which are essential for creating integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor components. In Taiwan, a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing, Process Technology plays a pivotal role in the advancement of electronics and information technology.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The evolution of Process Technology can be traced back to the 1960s, coinciding with the emergence of the first transistors and integrated circuits. Taiwan began its journey in semiconductor manufacturing in the late 1970s and has since transformed into a hub for advanced semiconductor fabrication. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a significant milestone, setting the foundation for advanced foundry services.

Over the years, Taiwan has experienced rapid technological advancements, particularly in scaling down process nodes from 10 micrometers in the late 1980s to 5 nanometers and below by the early 2020s. This has been driven by innovations in lithography techniques, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, and improvements in materials and etching processes.

## 相關技術與工程基礎

### Photolithography

Photolithography is a critical process in semiconductor fabrication, allowing for the patterning of circuits on silicon wafers. This process uses light to transfer geometric patterns from a photomask to a light-sensitive chemical photoresist on the substrate. Advances in lithography techniques, such as immersion and EUV lithography, have enabled smaller feature sizes and higher resolutions.

### Etching

Etching is employed to remove layers from the wafer surface, defining the features of the semiconductor device. There are two primary types of etching: wet etching, which uses liquid chemicals, and dry etching, which utilizes gases. The choice of etching method significantly impacts the precision and quality of the final product.

### Doping

Doping involves the introduction of impurities into the semiconductor material to alter its electrical properties. This process is vital for creating p-type and n-type semiconductors, which are fundamental for forming junctions in devices such as diodes and transistors.

### Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)

CVD is a process used to create thin films of materials on a substrate. This technique is crucial for depositing materials such as silicon dioxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (Si3N4), which serve as dielectric layers in integrated circuits.

## 最新趨勢

The semiconductor industry in Taiwan is currently witnessing several key trends:

### 3D Integration

The shift towards 3D integration techniques, such as Through-Silicon Via (TSV) and chip stacking, is gaining momentum. This approach enhances performance by reducing interconnect delays and increasing density, allowing for more compact designs.

### Advanced Node Technology
