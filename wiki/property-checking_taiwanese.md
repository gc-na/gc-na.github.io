# Property Checking (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Property Checking

Property Checking is a formal verification technique used to ensure that a design system, often in the realm of digital circuits and software, adheres to specified properties or requirements throughout its lifecycle. This process involves rigorous mathematical and logical methods to ascertain that the system behaves as expected under various conditions, thereby preventing potential failures or malfunctions in the final product. 

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Property Checking emerged from the field of formal verification in the late 20th century, paralleling advancements in semiconductor technology and the increasing complexity of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). Early methods relied on manual proof techniques, but as design complexity escalated, automated tools began to evolve. The introduction of model checking in the 1980s, alongside temporal logic, significantly propelled the development of Property Checking methodologies.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry experienced a revolution in the 1990s, leading to heightened demand for reliable verification methods. Taiwanese companies began investing in research and development to create robust Property Checking tools, thereby enhancing the reliability of their semiconductor products.

### Formal Verification

Formal verification is the umbrella under which Property Checking falls. It employs mathematical techniques to prove the correctness of a systemâ€™s design. Property Checking specifically focuses on validating certain properties, such as safety (the system will not reach an undesirable state) and liveness (the system will eventually reach a desirable state).

### Model Checking

Model Checking is a systematic method that explores all possible states of a system to verify whether specific properties hold. While Property Checking can involve Model Checking techniques, it may also utilize simulation-based approaches to validate properties, especially in early design stages.

### Simulation

Simulation is often employed in conjunction with Property Checking. While simulation allows engineers to observe system behavior under various conditions, Property Checking provides a more exhaustive method to ensure all potential states of the design meet specified properties.
