#Quantum Mechanical Simulation (English)

## Definition of Quantum Mechanical Simulation

Quantum Mechanical Simulation (QMS) refers to the computational techniques and methods employed to understand and predict the behavior of quantum systems at atomic and subatomic scales. Utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics, QMS allows researchers to simulate the properties and interactions of materials, molecules, and complex systems that classical simulation methods cannot accurately model. This technique is pivotal in various fields, including physics, chemistry, materials science, and semiconductor technology.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of quantum mechanical simulation can be traced back to the early 20th century with the establishment of quantum mechanics itself. Key milestones include:

- **1920s**: Development of wave mechanics and matrix mechanics by physicists like Schr√∂dinger and Heisenberg laid the groundwork for understanding quantum states.
- **1950s-1960s**: The advent of digital computers enabled the first simulations of simple quantum systems, notably through the Hartree-Fock method.
- **1970s-1980s**: Emergence of density functional theory (DFT) revolutionized quantum chemistry, allowing for more extensive and practical simulations of electrons in systems.
- **1990s**: The introduction of quantum Monte Carlo methods and advancements in algorithms significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of quantum simulations.

Recent advancements are marked by the integration of high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning (ML), and quantum computing technologies, which have further pushed the boundaries of what can be simulated.

### Quantum Mechanics Principles

Understanding QMS requires a solid grasp of several fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as:

- **Wave-Particle Duality**: The dual nature of particles, which exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
- **Superposition**: The ability of quantum systems to exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
- **Entanglement**: A phenomenon where particles become interlinked, such that the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of distance.

### Computational Methods

Several computational methods are essential in quantum mechanical simulations:

- **Ab Initio Methods**: These methods, including Hartree-Fock and DFT, rely on quantum mechanical principles without empirical parameters.
- **Semi-Empirical Methods**: These approaches combine quantum mechanics with empirical data, often used for larger systems where ab initio methods are computationally prohibitive.
- **Quantum Monte Carlo**: A stochastic method that uses random sampling to compute quantum states and observables.
