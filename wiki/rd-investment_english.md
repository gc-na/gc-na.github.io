# R&D Investment (English)

## Definition of R&D Investment

Research and Development (R&D) Investment refers to the allocation of financial resources towards the systematic activities that lead to innovations, improvements, or the creation of new products and processes. This investment is critical for technological advancement and often involves a combination of basic research, applied research, and experimental development. R&D investment is a key driver of economic growth and competitiveness, influencing various sectors, including manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, information technology, and semiconductor technology.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of R&D investment has evolved significantly over the decades. The term gained prominence during World War II when governments and industries recognized the importance of scientific research in developing new technologies. Post-war, the focus shifted towards commercial applications, leading to the establishment of formal R&D departments in corporations.

The semiconductor industry, in particular, has witnessed tremendous growth due to R&D investment. From the invention of the transistor in 1947 to the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), continuous R&D has driven miniaturization and performance improvements, enabling the modern digital age.
