# R&D Investment (Taiwanese)

## Definition of R&D Investment

Research and Development (R&D) Investment refers to the allocation of resources—financial, human, and technological—toward the creation and enhancement of products, processes, and technologies. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, R&D investment plays a crucial role in driving innovation, improving design methodologies, and advancing manufacturing capabilities. This investment is critical for maintaining competitive advantages, especially in rapidly evolving markets.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Early Development of Semiconductor Industry in Taiwan

Taiwan's semiconductor industry began to take shape in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily driven by government initiatives and foreign investments. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a pivotal point, enabling Taiwan to become a global leader in semiconductor foundry services. Over the decades, Taiwan has significantly increased its R&D investment in semiconductor technology, leading to substantial advancements in VLSI systems.

### Significant Milestones

- **1990s**: The growth of fabless semiconductor companies, which design chips without manufacturing them, increased demand for foundry services.
- **2000s**: The introduction of advanced manufacturing processes, such as 65nm and 45nm technology nodes, marked significant milestones in chip performance and efficiency.
- **2010s**: The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications propelled R&D investment into areas like machine learning algorithms and edge computing.
