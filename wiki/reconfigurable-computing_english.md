# Reconfigurable Computing (English)

## Definition of Reconfigurable Computing

Reconfigurable computing is an advanced computing paradigm that combines the flexibility of software with the performance of hardware. It enables the dynamic adaptation of hardware resources to accommodate varying computational workloads and application requirements. This is primarily achieved through the use of hardware devices such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), which can be reconfigured post-manufacturing to optimize performance for specific tasks.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of reconfigurable computing can be traced back to the 1980s when FPGAs were first introduced. Initial designs were rudimentary, featuring limited logic gates and simple interconnects. However, as semiconductor technology evolved, the capacity and performance of FPGAs dramatically improved, leading to widespread adoption in various applications.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the introduction of high-level synthesis tools allowed designers to program FPGAs using high-level programming languages, further enhancing usability. The advent of System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures integrated reconfigurable components with traditional microprocessors, enabling more efficient data processing.

The 2010s marked a significant era with the introduction of 28nm technology nodes and the development of more sophisticated reconfigurable architectures, including partial reconfiguration capabilities. Innovations such as High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and the integration of GPUs with FPGAs began to blur the lines between hardware and software, paving the way for more versatile computing solutions.
