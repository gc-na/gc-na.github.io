# Regression Testing (English)

## Definition of Regression Testing

Regression Testing is a type of software testing that aims to confirm that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities. It involves re-running previously completed tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. This process is vital in the software development lifecycle, particularly in agile and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) environments, where code is frequently updated.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of regression testing has evolved significantly since the early days of software development. Initially, software was often developed as monolithic applications where changes were infrequent and regression testing was a manual process. However, as software became more complex and modular, the need for automated regression testing emerged. 

The introduction of automated testing frameworks in the late 20th century marked a turning point. Tools such as Selenium, JUnit, and TestNG facilitated automated regression tests, allowing developers to quickly verify code changes. In recent years, the rise of DevOps practices has further accelerated the deployment of regression testing within CI/CD pipelines, integrating it into the software development process seamlessly.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Automated Testing Frameworks

Automated testing frameworks are essential for effective regression testing. These frameworks allow developers to create, manage, and execute test cases efficiently. Popular frameworks include:

- **Selenium**: Primarily used for web application testing, it supports multiple programming languages and browsers.
- **JUnit**: A widely used testing framework for Java applications, especially for unit and regression testing.
- **TestNG**: An extension of JUnit designed to cover a broader range of testing needs, including integration and functional testing.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD practices involve the automated integration and deployment of code changes. Regression testing is a crucial component of CI/CD, as it ensures that new code submissions do not break existing functionality. This practice allows for quicker feedback loops and more reliable software releases.

## Latest Trends in Regression Testing

1. **AI and Machine Learning**: The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into regression testing is gaining traction. These technologies can help optimize test case selection, predict high-risk areas of code, and automate the generation of test cases.

2. **Test Automation**: The shift towards complete test automation is increasingly common. Organizations are investing in tools that allow for easy integration of regression tests into their development workflows.

3. **Shift-Left Testing**: This approach emphasizes the importance of testing earlier in the software development lifecycle. By incorporating regression tests during the initial phases of development, teams can identify and fix issues sooner, leading to improved software quality.

## Major Applications of Regression Testing

Regression testing is employed across various sectors, including:

- **Web Development**: Ensuring that new features do not disrupt existing functionalities in web applications.
- **Mobile Applications**: Validating that updates or new features do not negatively impact the user experience or functionality.
- **Embedded Systems**: In systems like Automotive or IoT devices, where software updates must ensure that prior functionalities remain intact.
- **Financial Services**: In applications where compliance and reliability are critical, regression testing is mandatory to avoid costly errors.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions

Research in regression testing is increasingly focusing on:

- **Self-healing Test Automation**: Developing tests that can adapt automatically to changes in the application interface or behavior, reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Test Prioritization and Selection**: Investigating methods to select the most relevant tests to run after changes, thereby optimizing testing time and resources.
- **Cloud-based Testing**: Exploring the advantages of cloud infrastructure for running regression tests at scale, facilitating parallel execution and reducing time-to-market.

## A vs B: Regression Testing vs. Unit Testing

### Regression Testing

- Focuses on verifying that existing functionalities work post-change.
- Involves running a suite of tests that can include unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
- Typically executed after code changes in CI/CD pipelines to ensure overall system integrity.

### Unit Testing

- Concentrates on testing individual components or modules in isolation.
- Usually performed by developers during the coding phase.
- Aims to catch bugs early in the development process before integration.

While both testing types are crucial, regression testing serves a broader purpose of validating the entire system, whereas unit testing is more granular, focusing on specific code units.
