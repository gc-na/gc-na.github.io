#Routing Automation (English)

## Definition of Routing Automation

Routing Automation refers to the process of utilizing software tools and algorithms to optimize the routing of interconnections in integrated circuit designs, particularly in the context of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. It involves the automatic generation of the physical layout of wiring that connects various components of a circuit, aiming to minimize area, delay, and power consumption while maximizing performance and manufacturability.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Routing Automation emerged in the early days of VLSI design during the 1970s, driven by the need for efficient circuit layout techniques as the complexity of electronic systems increased. Early routing algorithms were predominantly based on manual processes and rudimentary heuristics. Over time, advancements in computational power and algorithmic techniques led to the development of sophisticated tools capable of handling more complex designs.

The introduction of graph-based algorithms, such as maze routing and global routing, significantly improved routing efficiency and accuracy. The transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional VLSI systems further spurred innovations in routing automation, necessitating novel approaches to manage increased complexity and density.
