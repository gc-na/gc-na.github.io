# Routing Automation (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Routing Automation

Routing Automation refers to the computer-aided design (CAD) techniques utilized to determine the optimal paths for electrical interconnections in semiconductor devices, particularly in the layout of integrated circuits (ICs). This process is crucial in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, where millions of components must be connected with minimal delay and power consumption while maximizing area efficiency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Routing Automation emerged in the 1980s, paralleling the rapid growth of semiconductor technology and the increasing complexity of circuit designs. Early routing techniques were predominantly manual, but as IC designs grew more intricate, the need for automated solutions became apparent. Pioneering algorithms such as the Lee Algorithm and the A* search algorithm laid the foundation for modern routing methods, transitioning from grid-based layouts to more sophisticated approaches.

With the advent of advanced technologies such as FinFETs and 3D ICs, routing tools have evolved to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence, enabling designers to handle complexity with greater efficiency. Recent advancements include hierarchical routing techniques and the use of concurrent optimization strategies.

### CAD Tools

Routing Automation is typically integrated into a broader suite of CAD tools that aid in the design, simulation, and verification of semiconductor devices. Key functionalities include:

- **Placement Tools:** Determine the optimal location of components on the silicon die.
- **Routing Engines:** Establish interconnections while adhering to design rules.
- **Design Rule Checkers (DRC):** Validate that the design adheres to fabrication constraints.

### Technology Node Scaling

As technology nodes shrink (e.g., 7nm, 5nm, 3nm), the challenges in routing automation increase due to reduced feature sizes and increased density. This necessitates more sophisticated routing algorithms that can optimize for multiple objectives simultaneously, such as power, performance, and area (PPA).
