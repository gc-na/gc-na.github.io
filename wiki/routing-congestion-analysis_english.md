# Routing Congestion Analysis (English)

## Definition of Routing Congestion Analysis

Routing Congestion Analysis is a critical aspect of electronic design automation (EDA) focused on evaluating and mitigating congestion in the routing of interconnections within integrated circuits (ICs). It involves the assessment of how densely packed the routing resources are in a given layout, predicting potential issues that might arise due to insufficient routing capacity, and optimizing the arrangement of connections to ensure efficient signal transmission without delays or signal integrity issues.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The need for Routing Congestion Analysis arose with the advent of complex integrated circuits in the late 20th century. As semiconductor technology advanced, enabling the fabrication of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), the complexity of layouts increased significantly. Early routing algorithms, primarily grid-based, struggled to accommodate the growing number of interconnections, leading to the development of more sophisticated techniques.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the introduction of global and detailed routing algorithms marked a significant leap forward. These algorithms took advantage of advanced optimization techniques, including linear programming and heuristic methods, to manage congestion more effectively. The transition to smaller technology nodes (e.g., from 90nm to 7nm and beyond) further necessitated improvements in Routing Congestion Analysis due to the increased density of components.

## Engineering Fundamentals

### Basic Concepts

Routing congestion occurs when the demand for routing resources exceeds their available capacity, leading to potential delays, increased power consumption, and compromised signal integrity. Understanding basic concepts such as the following is essential for effective Routing Congestion Analysis:

- **Routing Layers**: Different metal layers in IC design that facilitate signal transmission.
- **Via**: A vertical connection between different metal layers.
- **Congestion Metrics**: Quantitative measures indicating the level of congestion in routing paths.

### Tools and Techniques

The analysis involves various tools and methodologies, including:

- **Congestion Graphs**: Visual representations of routing density, helping designers to identify hotspots.
- **Multi-layer Routing**: Techniques that utilize multiple metal layers for better signal routing.
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Ensuring that the design adheres to manufacturing constraints, crucial in identifying areas prone to congestion.

## Latest Trends

### Advanced Congestion Prediction

Recent advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have started to influence Routing Congestion Analysis. Algorithms that predict congestion patterns based on historical data are being developed, enabling proactive design adjustments.

### 3D ICs and Heterogeneous Integration

As semiconductor technology shifts towards three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) and heterogeneous integration, Routing Congestion Analysis has adapted to account for the unique challenges posed by these architectures. The interconnection between vertically stacked dies introduces new routing complexities that require innovative analysis techniques.

## Major Applications
