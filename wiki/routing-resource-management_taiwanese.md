# Routing Resource Management (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Routing Resource Management

Routing Resource Management (RRM) refers to the methodologies and techniques used to efficiently allocate and manage routing resources within integrated circuits (IC) and systems-on-chip (SoC) designs. This encompasses the management of routing layers in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) to optimize signal integrity, minimize delay, and reduce power consumption. RRM plays a crucial role in the design process, ensuring that the interconnections between various components are optimized for performance and yield.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The field of Routing Resource Management has evolved significantly over the years, paralleling advancements in semiconductor technology. In the early days of VLSI design, routing was largely a manual process, with engineers physically placing and connecting components on silicon wafers. As IC designs grew in complexity, the need for sophisticated routing algorithms became evident.

### Milestones in RRM Development

1. **Early Automation**: The introduction of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools in the 1980s allowed for automated routing techniques, improving efficiency and accuracy.
2. **Hierarchical Design**: The development of hierarchical design methodologies in the 1990s enabled designers to manage complexity by breaking down large designs into smaller, manageable blocks.
3. **Global Routing Algorithms**: The 2000s saw advancements in global routing algorithms capable of handling larger designs with multiple layers, facilitating the integration of diverse functionalities on a single chip.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Routing Techniques

1. **Global Routing**: This involves determining the overall paths that signals will take across the entire chip, focusing on minimizing congestion and optimizing resource usage.
2. **Detailed Routing**: Following global routing, detailed routing specifies the exact paths for each net, considering layer assignments and avoiding design rule violations.

### Design Rule Checking (DRC)

DRC is an essential component of RRM, ensuring that the design adheres to the manufacturing constraints imposed by the fabrication process. This includes checking for spacing violations, width limitations, and layer-specific requirements.

### Place and Route (P&R)

The Place and Route process combines placement of components on the silicon die with routing of interconnections. Effective P&R techniques are critical for optimal RRM, as they directly influence the performance and manufacturability of the final product.
