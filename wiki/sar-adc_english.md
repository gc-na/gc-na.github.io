# SAR ADC (English)

## Definition of SAR ADC

A Successive Approximation Register Analog-to-Digital Converter (SAR ADC) is a type of ADC that converts an analog signal into a digital signal by using a binary search algorithm. The core mechanism of the SAR ADC involves a comparator, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and a successive approximation register. The SAR ADC operates by successively approximating the input voltage until it finds the correct digital representation, making it highly efficient and suitable for medium-speed applications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Early Development

The SAR ADC architecture emerged in the late 20th century as a response to the increasing demand for precise and efficient analog-to-digital conversion in various electronic applications. Early implementations were limited by technology constraints, such as the resolution of the DACs and the speed of comparators.

### Technological Advancements

With advancements in semiconductor technology and VLSI fabrication techniques, SAR ADCs have witnessed significant improvements. The introduction of advanced CMOS technology has enabled higher resolutions (up to 16 bits and beyond) and improved sampling rates, making SAR ADCs suitable for applications in telecommunications, automotive systems, and medical devices.

## Engineering Fundamentals

### Operation Principle

The SAR ADC operates in several key steps:

1. **Sample Phase**: The analog input signal is sampled and held constant.
2. **Comparison Phase**: The sampled voltage is compared to a reference voltage generated by a DAC.
3. **Successive Approximation**: The SAR logic sets a bit in the digital output based on the comparison results, and the process is repeated until all bits are determined.

### Key Components

- **Comparator**: A high-speed operational amplifier that determines whether the input voltage is higher or lower than the reference voltage.
- **DAC**: Converts the digital signal back into an analog signal for comparison.
- **Successive Approximation Register**: A binary register that stores the current approximation of the input signal.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
