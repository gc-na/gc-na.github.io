# Scan Architecture (English)

## Definition of Scan Architecture

Scan Architecture refers to a design methodology in digital integrated circuits that facilitates the testing and debugging of circuits by enabling the observation and control of internal states. This is primarily achieved through the incorporation of scan flip-flops in the circuit design, which allows for the shifting in and out of data patterns. By transforming sequential circuits into a combination of scan chains, engineers can effectively test the functionality of each flip-flop, ensure fault detection, and improve overall yield.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Scan Architecture emerged in the 1980s as a response to the increasing complexity of digital circuits, particularly in Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and microprocessors. As integrated circuits became denser, traditional testing methods proved inadequate, leading to higher costs and longer development times. The introduction of scan design techniques, particularly the Scan Path and Scan Chain methodologies, allowed for the systematic testing of logic states without the need for extensive hardware modifications.

Over the years, advancements in fabrication technologies and design automation tools have contributed to the evolution of Scan Architecture. Techniques such as Design for Testability (DFT) and Built-In Self-Test (BIST) have become integral to the implementation of scan-based testing, allowing for improved test coverage and reduced time-to-market.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Design for Testability (DFT)

DFT encompasses a set of design practices that enhance the testability of a circuit. Scan Architecture is a prominent DFT strategy that facilitates easier access to internal states, enabling engineers to identify and rectify faults more efficiently.

### Built-In Self-Test (BIST)

BIST is another complementary technology that integrates test generation and response analysis into the hardware itself. While Scan Architecture primarily focuses on external testing mechanisms, BIST offers a self-contained method for testing, which can be particularly useful in environments where external testing is impractical.
