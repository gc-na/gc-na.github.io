# Scan Chain Partitioning (English)

## Definition

Scan Chain Partitioning is a design methodology used in digital integrated circuit testing, particularly for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs). It involves dividing a single scan chain into multiple smaller chains to improve the efficiency of test data application, fault localization, and overall test coverage. By segmenting the scan chain, designers can achieve a balance between test time, area overhead, and power consumption.

## Historical Background

The concept of scan chain testing emerged in the 1980s as a response to the increasing complexity of VLSI circuits and the growing demand for reliable testing methods. The traditional approach involved using a single long scan chain, which presented challenges in terms of test time and data integrity. The introduction of scan chain partitioning marked a significant advancement, allowing for parallel test application and reduced overall testing time.

Technological advancements in semiconductor fabrication and design automation tools have further propelled the adoption of scan chain partitioning. This methodology has evolved to address the needs of modern high-speed, low-power devices, accommodating the demands of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and mobile computing.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Scan Testing

Scan testing refers to a design-for-testability (DFT) technique that facilitates the detection of faults in digital circuits. It integrates additional flip-flops, called scan cells, into the circuit design, allowing for the observation and control of internal states during testing. Scan chain partitioning builds on this foundational concept, optimizing the scan testing process.

### Built-In Self-Test (BIST)

BIST is another testing methodology that allows a circuit to test itself using built-in mechanisms. While BIST provides advantages in terms of automation and reduced reliance on external test equipment, it often requires a more complex design. Scan Chain Partitioning can be integrated with BIST to enhance test coverage and efficiency.

### Design for Testability (DFT)

DFT encompasses a range of techniques aimed at improving the testability of a circuit. Scan Chain Partitioning is a specialized DFT approach, focusing on the arrangement and management of scan chains to optimize testing processes.
