# Scan Testing (English)

## Definition of Scan Testing

Scan testing is a design-for-testability (DFT) technique used to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). This methodology allows for the efficient detection of manufacturing defects and faults in complex digital circuits by embedding additional test circuitry within the design. Scan testing transforms sequential circuits into a combinational-like structure, enabling easy access to internal states through a series of scan chains.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of scan testing emerged in the 1980s as the complexity of digital circuits began to exceed the capabilities of traditional testing methods. Pioneering work by researchers such as David W. M. L. van der Meer and others led to the development of the scan flip-flop, a key component in enabling scan-based testing. Over the years, advancements in semiconductor fabrication technology and design automation tools have further refined scan testing methodologies, leading to the widespread adoption of techniques such as boundary scan and built-in self-test (BIST).

### Scan Test Architecture

Scan testing typically involves the implementation of scan chains within the design. These chains consist of a series of scan flip-flops connected in a linear fashion, allowing for serial input and output of test data. The basic architecture includes:

- **Scan Flip-Flops**: Enhanced flip-flops that can operate in both normal and test modes.
- **Test Access Port (TAP)**: A standardized interface for accessing the scan chains, as described in the IEEE 1149.1 standard.
- **Test Pattern Generation**: Algorithms and tools that generate specific input patterns to exercise the circuit and observe the outputs.
