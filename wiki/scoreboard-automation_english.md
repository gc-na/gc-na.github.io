# Scoreboard Automation (English)

## Definition of Scoreboard Automation
Scoreboard Automation refers to the integration of automated systems and technologies to monitor, manage, and display live scores, statistics, and relevant information in various competitive sports and events. These systems utilize real-time data acquisition, processing algorithms, and display technologies to enhance the experience for players, officials, and spectators. Scoreboard Automation can be implemented in arenas, stadiums, and other venues to streamline operations and improve the efficiency of scorekeeping.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The origins of scoreboard automation can be traced back to the early 20th century when mechanical devices were first used to display scores at sporting events. With the advent of electronic technology in the 1960s, early electronic scoreboards began to replace their mechanical counterparts. The introduction of microcontrollers and digital displays in the 1980s marked a significant technological advancement, allowing for more dynamic and interactive scoreboard functionalities.

The 21st century has seen rapid advancements in scoreboard automation, driven by developments in microelectronics, software engineering, and telecommunications. The integration of wireless technologies, cloud computing, and data analytics has further transformed how scoreboards operate, enabling real-time updates and remote management.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Embedded Systems
Scoreboard automation heavily relies on embedded systems that integrate hardware and software to perform dedicated functions. Microcontrollers and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are commonly used to control display elements and manage data inputs.

### Data Acquisition and Processing
Automated scoreboards utilize sensors and communication protocols (like RS-232, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi) to collect and transmit data from various sources, including officiating teams and timing systems. The data is processed using algorithms to ensure accuracy and real-time display.
