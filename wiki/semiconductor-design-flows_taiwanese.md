# Semiconductor Design Flows (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Semiconductor Design Flows

Semiconductor Design Flows refer to the structured sequence of processes and methodologies used to develop semiconductor devices, particularly Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). These flows encompass various stages, including specification, design entry, validation, synthesis, layout, and manufacturing, facilitating an efficient transition from concept to production.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of semiconductor design flows can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuits in the 1960s. Initially, the design process was manual and labor-intensive, limiting the complexity and functionality of devices. With the advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools in the 1980s, the design process became more automated, allowing for the handling of increasingly complex designs.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry began to gain prominence in the 1990s, with companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) revolutionizing the foundry model. The integration of advanced design tools and methodologies, such as Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and high-level synthesis, has significantly contributed to the sophistication of semiconductor design flows in the region.
