The field of semiconductor device simulation has its roots in the mid-20th century when the advent of semiconductor materials revolutionized electronics. Early simulations relied on analytical models based on empirical data derived from experimental observations. As computational power increased, numerical techniques such as finite element analysis (FEA) and Monte Carlo methods became integral to simulating complex semiconductor phenomena.

In the 1980s, the development of software tools like SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) marked a significant advancement in circuit simulation. This was followed by the creation of specialized software for device simulation, such as Sentaurus and Silvaco, which included sophisticated models for carrier transport, recombination, and thermal effects. The introduction of quantum mechanical models and the incorporation of machine learning techniques in recent years have further enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of device simulations.
