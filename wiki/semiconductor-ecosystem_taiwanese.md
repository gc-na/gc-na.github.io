# Semiconductor Ecosystem (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Semiconductor Ecosystem

The Semiconductor Ecosystem refers to the intricate network of organizations, technologies, and processes involved in the design, manufacturing, testing, and distribution of semiconductor devices. This ecosystem encompasses various entities, including foundries, design houses, equipment manufacturers, and research institutions, all of which play vital roles in the global semiconductor supply chain. Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem is particularly significant due to its advanced capabilities and contributions to the global market.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan's semiconductor industry has its roots in the 1970s when the government initiated a series of policies to promote technology development. The establishment of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in 1973 marked a pivotal moment, leading to significant advancements in semiconductor manufacturing and design. 

In the 1980s, the formation of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 revolutionized the industry by introducing the foundry model, allowing fabless companies to design chips without the burden of manufacturing. Over the years, Taiwan has consistently invested in research and development, leading to breakthroughs in technologies such as FinFET, 3D ICs, and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.
