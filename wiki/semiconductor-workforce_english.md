# Semiconductor Workforce (English)

## Definition of Semiconductor Workforce

The Semiconductor Workforce refers to the collective pool of professionals, engineers, researchers, and technicians who are engaged in the design, fabrication, testing, and maintenance of semiconductor devices. This workforce is pivotal in supporting the semiconductor industry, which serves as the backbone of modern electronics, enabling advancements in computing, communications, consumer electronics, and various other sectors.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The semiconductor industry originated in the mid-20th century with the development of the first transistor in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. This innovation marked the beginning of a technological revolution, leading to the creation of integrated circuits (ICs) in the late 1950s. As the demand for smaller, more efficient electronic devices surged, the semiconductor workforce evolved, embracing new technologies such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which became the dominant fabrication process.

Over the decades, significant advancements in semiconductor technology have been driven by the workforce's ability to innovate in areas such as photolithography, doping processes, and materials science. The introduction of advanced packaging techniques and three-dimensional (3D) integrated circuits has further expanded the role of the semiconductor workforce.
