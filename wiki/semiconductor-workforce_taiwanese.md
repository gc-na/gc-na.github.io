# Semiconductor Workforce (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Semiconductor Workforce

The Semiconductor Workforce refers to the collective body of professionals engaged in the design, manufacturing, and innovation of semiconductor devices and integrated circuits (ICs) within Taiwanâ€™s thriving semiconductor industry. This workforce encompasses a diverse range of occupations, including engineers, technicians, researchers, and support staff, all of whom contribute to various stages of semiconductor development, from material science and fabrication to testing and quality assurance.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan's semiconductor industry has grown exponentially since the 1980s, largely driven by government initiatives and investments in technology. The establishment of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a pivotal moment, positioning Taiwan as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing. The industry has since evolved through technological advancements such as Moore's Law, which predicts the doubling of transistor density on ICs approximately every two years, thus requiring a skilled workforce adept at rapid innovation and complex engineering challenges.
