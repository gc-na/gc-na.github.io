# Sequential Equivalence Checking (English)

## Definition of Sequential Equivalence Checking

Sequential Equivalence Checking (SEC) is a formal verification technique used in the design of digital circuits, particularly in the context of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The primary objective of SEC is to establish that two sequential circuits, typically a reference implementation and a modified version, exhibit equivalent behavior over all possible input sequences. This process ensures that any transformations or optimizations applied to the design do not alter its functional output across all operational states.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of Sequential Equivalence Checking can be traced back to the growth of formal verification methods in the late 20th century. Early efforts focused on combinational equivalence checking, which dealt with static circuits without memory elements. However, with the increasing complexity of digital systems, the need for verification techniques capable of handling sequential behaviors became apparent.

In the 1990s, researchers began developing algorithms that could efficiently handle the state space explosion problem, a significant challenge associated with verifying sequential circuits. Techniques such as Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and symbolic model checking emerged as foundational tools for SEC. The introduction of abstraction techniques, such as state space reduction and partitioning, further improved the feasibility of SEC in practical applications.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Formal Verification Techniques

Sequential Equivalence Checking is closely related to several formal verification methods, including:

- **Model Checking:** A technique that exhaustively explores the state space of a model to verify whether certain properties hold true, often used for safety and liveness properties.
- **Equivalence Checking:** Generally focuses on verifying the equivalence of combinational circuits, where the states and transitions are not considered.
- **Property Checking:** This involves verifying that a certain property (e.g., invariants) holds true during the execution of a design.
  
### Comparison: SEC vs. Model Checking

While both Sequential Equivalence Checking and Model Checking aim to verify the correctness of designs, they differ in scope and methodology. SEC specifically compares two versions of a sequential circuit to ensure they are functionally identical, whereas Model Checking verifies whether a specific design meets a set of desired properties across all possible states.

## Latest Trends in Sequential Equivalence Checking

Recent advancements in SEC have been driven by the increasing complexity of digital designs, particularly in the context of System-on-Chip (SoC) implementations. Key trends include:

- **Integration with Machine Learning:** Researchers are exploring the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the efficiency of SEC tools, particularly in state space reduction and pattern recognition.
- **Scalability Improvements:** New algorithms and data structures, such as multi-level BDDs and SAT-based approaches, are being developed to handle larger designs more effectively.
- **Concurrent Verification:** Techniques that allow verification of multiple designs or properties simultaneously are gaining traction, enabling faster turnaround times in the design process.

## Major Applications

Sequential Equivalence Checking is widely employed in various domains, including:

- **Integrated Circuit Design:** SEC is essential for validating optimizations and transformations in digital designs, ensuring that modifications do not introduce functional errors.
- **Hardware Security:** In the context of hardware Trojans and intellectual property (IP) protection, SEC helps verify that security measures do not compromise the functionality of the circuit.
- **Automotive and Avionics Systems:** Given the critical nature of these applications, SEC is used to ensure that safety-critical systems behave as intended, even after updates or modifications.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions

Current research in Sequential Equivalence Checking is focused on several key areas:

- **Handling Non-Determinism:** Addressing the challenges posed by non-deterministic behaviors in sequential systems remains an active area of exploration.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining SEC with other verification methods to create more robust frameworks capable of handling complex designs.
- **Advanced Formal Methods:** Development of new theoretical foundations that enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of SEC.
