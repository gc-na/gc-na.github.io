# Sigma-Delta ADC (English)

## Definition
A Sigma-Delta Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a type of converter that uses oversampling and noise shaping techniques to achieve high-resolution digital representations of analog signals. It operates by employing a delta-sigma modulator to convert the analog input signal into a stream of digital pulses, which are then filtered and decimated to produce a high-resolution digital output.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The development of Sigma-Delta ADCs can be traced back to the 1960s, with early theoretical foundations laid by researchers exploring the principles of oversampling and noise shaping. The introduction of integrated circuit technology in the 1980s allowed for the practical implementation of these concepts, leading to significant advancements in the performance and affordability of Sigma-Delta ADCs.

The 1990s saw a surge in the adoption of Sigma-Delta ADCs in consumer electronics, driven by the demand for high-fidelity audio and precision measurement applications. Key technological advancements have included improved digital filters, enhanced modulator designs, and the integration of Sigma-Delta ADCs into System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Modulation Techniques
Sigma-Delta ADCs utilize a modulation process that combines sigma (Σ) and delta (Δ) elements. The sigma component represents the summation of the input signal and feedback from the digital output, while the delta component captures the difference between the current and previous samples. This unique approach allows for effective noise shaping, which pushes quantization noise out of the frequency band of interest.

### Oversampling and Noise Shaping
Oversampling is a critical technique employed by Sigma-Delta ADCs, where the input signal is sampled at a rate significantly higher than the Nyquist frequency. This oversampling, coupled with noise shaping, allows for better signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and reduced distortion. The noise shaping process redistributes quantization noise to higher frequencies, which can be effectively filtered out during the decimation stage.
