# Signal Conditioning (English)

## Definition of Signal Conditioning

Signal conditioning refers to the process of manipulating an analog signal in such a way that it meets the requirements of the next stage for processing, transmission, or conversion to a digital signal. This process may involve amplification, filtering, converting, and isolating the signal to enhance its quality for further analysis or transmission. Signal conditioning is crucial in various applications, including data acquisition systems, instrumentation, and communication systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Signal conditioning has its roots in the early 20th century with the emergence of electrical instrumentation. As technology advanced, particularly with the advent of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital signal processing (DSP), the need for sophisticated signal conditioning techniques grew. By the late 20th century, integrated circuits (ICs) became pivotal in developing dedicated signal conditioning modules that improved performance while reducing size and cost.

Recent advancements include the integration of signal conditioning with microcontrollers and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), allowing for more complex and flexible conditioning techniques. The emergence of Industry 4.0 and the Internet of Things (IoT) has further driven innovation in signal conditioning, as these technologies require robust and efficient data processing capabilities.
