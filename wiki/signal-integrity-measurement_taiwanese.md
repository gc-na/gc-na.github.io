# Signal Integrity Measurement (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Signal Integrity Measurement refers to the process of assessing the quality of electrical signals within a digital circuit or system. It focuses on determining how well the signal maintains its integrity as it travels through various components, including printed circuit boards (PCBs), connectors, and integrated circuits. The measurement encompasses various parameters such as signal rise and fall times, overshoot, undershoot, and jitter, which can significantly impact the performance and reliability of digital systems.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The concept of Signal Integrity Measurement emerged in the late 20th century alongside advancements in semiconductor technology and VLSI systems. As integrated circuits became more complex and operated at higher frequencies, the need for precise measurement techniques became paramount. Early measurements relied on oscilloscopes and basic signal analyzers, but as technology progressed, specialized tools like Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and Vector Network Analyzers (VNAs) were developed.

In recent decades, technological advancements such as high-speed digital design, advanced simulation tools, and real-time measurement systems have revolutionized the field. The integration of software and hardware solutions has enabled engineers to perform more accurate and efficient measurements, leading to improved signal quality in high-performance applications.

### Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)

TDR is a widely used technique for Signal Integrity Measurement. It involves sending a fast-rise time pulse down a transmission line and analyzing the reflected signals to identify discontinuities, such as impedance mismatches. TDR is particularly effective in locating faults and ensuring proper termination in high-speed interconnects.

### Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)

A VNA is another crucial instrument used in Signal Integrity Measurement. It characterizes the frequency response of devices, providing insights into how signals behave at different frequencies. VNAs are essential for analyzing S-parameters, which describe how RF signals are transmitted and reflected through a network.
