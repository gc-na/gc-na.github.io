## Definition of Silicon Characterization

Silicon Characterization refers to the comprehensive set of techniques and methods employed to analyze the physical, electrical, and structural properties of silicon materials, particularly in the context of semiconductor device fabrication. This process is critical for understanding the behavior of silicon in various applications, including but not limited to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan has emerged as a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry since the late 20th century, transitioning from a manufacturing-based economy to a leading hub for advanced semiconductor technology. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a significant leap forward, facilitating rapid advancements in silicon characterization techniques. Over the years, technologies such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) have evolved, enabling more precise characterization of silicon materials at the nanoscale.
