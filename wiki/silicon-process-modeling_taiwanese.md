#Silicon Process Modeling (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Silicon Process Modeling refers to the simulation and analysis of the various processes involved in the fabrication of semiconductor devices, particularly focused on silicon-based technologies. This modeling encompasses a range of methodologies that predict the physical, electrical, and thermal behavior of semiconductor materials during different stages of manufacturing, including doping, etching, and deposition. 

## 歷史背景與技術進步

Silicon Process Modeling has its roots in the early days of semiconductor manufacturing in the 1960s, when engineers began to develop empirical models based on trial-and-error methods. As semiconductor technology advanced, particularly with the introduction of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology in the 1980s, the complexity of processes required more sophisticated modeling techniques.

By the late 1990s, the advent of computational power and numerical methods enabled the development of advanced modeling tools such as TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design). These tools allowed for the simulation of the physical and electrostatic properties of semiconductor devices, leading to more efficient design processes and optimized fabrication techniques.
