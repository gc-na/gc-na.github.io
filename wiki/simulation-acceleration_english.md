# Simulation Acceleration (English)

## Definition of Simulation Acceleration

Simulation acceleration refers to the enhancement of the speed and efficiency of simulation processes used in the design and verification of complex systems, such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs). This process often employs specialized hardware and software techniques to reduce the time required for simulation while maintaining the accuracy and fidelity of the results. The goal is to allow engineers to explore design alternatives, verify performance, and detect errors early in the development cycle, thereby reducing time-to-market and development costs.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of simulation in electronic design dates back to the early days of computing, where simple circuit simulations were performed to validate designs before fabrication. Over the decades, with the increasing complexity of electronic systems, traditional simulation methods became inadequate. The advent of VLSI technology in the 1980s led to the development of more sophisticated simulation tools, but the need for acceleration became apparent as designs grew more intricate.

The introduction of hardware acceleration, particularly with the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), marked a significant leap in simulation acceleration technology. These platforms enabled parallel processing capabilities that could effectively handle large volumes of simulation data, reducing simulation times from days to hours or even minutes.
