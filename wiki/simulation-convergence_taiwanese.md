# Simulation Convergence (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Simulation Convergence

Simulation Convergence refers to the process by which a simulation model reaches a stable solution that accurately reflects the behavior of the system being modeled. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, convergence is essential for ensuring that simulations of electrical circuits, physical phenomena, and thermal dynamics yield reliable results. Convergence is typically assessed through various numerical methods and algorithms that iteratively refine the output until it meets predefined criteria for accuracy and stability.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of simulation convergence has evolved significantly since the inception of computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the 1960s. Early simulation tools employed simple models and limited computational power, leading to challenges in achieving convergence. However, advancements in algorithms, such as Newton-Raphson and Gauss-Seidel methods, have allowed for more complex simulations to converge effectively. The introduction of more powerful computing hardware, including parallel processing and high-performance computing (HPC) systems, has further facilitated the convergence of sophisticated models in semiconductor design.
