# Simulation Performance Optimization (Taiwanese)

## Definition

Simulation Performance Optimization (SPO) refers to the process of enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of simulation models used in various engineering fields. This optimization aims to reduce computational time and resource consumption while maintaining or improving the fidelity of the simulation results. In semiconductor technology and VLSI systems, SPO is crucial as it directly impacts design cycles, time-to-market, and overall project costs.

## Historical Background

Historically, simulation in semiconductor design began with simplistic models that were computationally less intensive. As technologies advanced, so did the complexity of models, necessitating more sophisticated simulation tools. The evolution of software such as SPICE for circuit simulation in the 1970s marked a significant milestone. Over the years, advancements in hardware, such as multi-core processors and GPUs, coupled with the development of parallel processing techniques, have significantly influenced the landscape of SPO.
