# Simulation (台語)

## 定義 (Definition)
Simulation, or 模擬 in 台語, is the process of creating a model or representation of a system to analyze its behavior under various conditions. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, simulation is critical for predicting the performance, reliability, and functionality of integrated circuits before physical fabrication. By employing computational algorithms and methodologies, engineers can evaluate how changes in design parameters affect the system’s performance.

## 歷史背景與技術進步 (Historical Background and Technological Advancements)
The concept of simulation dates back to the early days of computing in the 1950s, primarily used for military and aerospace applications. As semiconductor technology evolved, so did the complexity of integrated circuits, necessitating more sophisticated simulation tools. The introduction of SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) in 1973 marked a significant milestone in circuit simulation, enabling engineers to model and analyze electronic circuits efficiently.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, advancements in computational power and algorithms facilitated the development of more comprehensive simulation tools, including those for layout and timing analysis. The emergence of VLSI systems in the late 20th century led to the need for more advanced tools that could handle the complexities of modern chip design.

In recent years, the introduction of technologies such as 5nm process nodes, Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAA FET), and Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has further transformed simulation practices. These technologies demand precise and highly detailed simulations to ensure optimal design and performance.
