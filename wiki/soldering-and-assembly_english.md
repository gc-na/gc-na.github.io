# Soldering and Assembly (English)

## Definition of Soldering and Assembly

Soldering is a process used to join two or more electronic components together by melting solder around the connection. The solder, typically made of a combination of tin and lead or lead-free alloys, cools and solidifies, forming a strong electrical and mechanical bond. Assembly, in the context of electronics, refers to the systematic process of placing and securing these components onto a substrate, such as a printed circuit board (PCB), to create functional electronic devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Soldering has a rich history that dates back over 5,000 years, with early applications found in jewelry and metalwork. The modern era of soldering began in the late 19th century with the advent of electrical engineering. The introduction of tin-lead solder significantly improved the reliability of electrical connections, leading to its widespread use in the burgeoning electronics industry.

In the late 20th century, the move towards miniaturization and increased complexity in electronic devices prompted advancements in soldering techniques. The introduction of surface-mount technology (SMT) allowed components to be mounted directly onto the surface of PCBs, requiring different soldering methods such as reflow soldering. The development of lead-free solder alloys, motivated by environmental concerns and regulatory frameworks like the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, marked a significant shift in soldering practices.
