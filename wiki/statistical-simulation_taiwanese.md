# Statistical Simulation (Taiwanese)

## 定義 (Definition)

Statistical simulation refers to the process of using statistical methods to create computational models that mimic the behavior of complex systems. This technique employs random sampling to estimate mathematical functions and mimic the operation of real-world processes. By generating a multitude of scenarios, statistical simulation allows engineers and researchers to analyze the probability of various outcomes, thereby providing insights that support decision-making and design optimization.

## 歷史背景與技術進步 (Historical Background and Technological Advancements)

The concept of statistical simulation has its roots in the Monte Carlo method, developed during the 1940s. Initially used in nuclear physics, this technique has evolved significantly over the decades. By the late 20th century, advancements in computing power and algorithms paved the way for widespread adoption in various fields, including semiconductor technology and VLSI systems.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry began to flourish in the late 20th century, with companies like TSMC leading the charge. The integration of statistical simulation into the design process has allowed Taiwanese companies to optimize chip design and manufacturing processes, contributing to the global semiconductor supply chain.
