# Statistical Timing Analysis (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Statistical Timing Analysis (STA) refers to a set of methodologies used in the design and verification of digital circuits, particularly in the context of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. The primary goal of STA is to evaluate the timing performance of a circuit under variations in manufacturing processes, environmental conditions, and operational parameters. Unlike traditional deterministic timing analysis, which assumes fixed parameters, statistical timing analysis incorporates variability to predict a circuit's performance more accurately.

## 歷史背景與技術發展

### 歷史背景

The evolution of Statistical Timing Analysis can be traced back to the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices and the need for more accurate timing predictions. As the semiconductor industry transitioned to smaller technology nodes—such as 65 nm and below—the impact of process variations became more pronounced. Traditional timing analysis methods were no longer sufficient to ensure that designs met their timing constraints across all variations.

### 技術發展

Recent advancements in algorithms and computational power have enabled the practical implementation of statistical methods in timing analysis. The introduction of Monte Carlo simulations, statistical static timing analysis tools, and machine learning techniques has significantly improved the accuracy of timing predictions.
