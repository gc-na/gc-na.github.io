# Stuck-At Fault (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Stuck-At Fault

Stuck-At Fault (SAF) is a common type of fault in digital circuits, particularly in the context of digital integrated circuits such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A Stuck-At Fault occurs when a signal line is permanently fixed at a logic high (1) or logic low (0), regardless of the intended logical operation. This fault impedes the normal functionality of the circuit, leading to incorrect outputs, and is a crucial aspect of fault modeling in testing and reliability engineering.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The Stuck-At Fault model has its origins in the early days of digital circuit design, as engineers sought to develop effective testing methodologies for integrated circuits. The concept gained prominence in the 1970s, coinciding with the rise of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) technology. As the complexity of circuits increased, the need for reliable fault detection methods became paramount. The Stuck-At Fault model became a foundational element in Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG), allowing engineers to create test patterns that could effectively identify such faults.

Over the decades, advancements in semiconductor technology have allowed for increased miniaturization and integration of components, leading to more complex circuits. Consequently, research has focused on enhancing fault modeling techniques, including dynamic faults, bridging faults, and more complex fault models beyond the Stuck-At paradigm.
