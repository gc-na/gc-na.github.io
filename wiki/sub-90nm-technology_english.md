# Sub-90nm Technology (English)

## Definition of Sub-90nm Technology

Sub-90nm Technology refers to semiconductor fabrication processes that utilize feature sizes smaller than 90 nanometers (nm). This threshold marks a significant shift in the semiconductor industry, as devices built using these technologies can achieve higher performance, lower power consumption, and increased functionality. The term encompasses various manufacturing techniques that enable the design and production of integrated circuits (ICs) with advanced transistor architectures, such as Fin Field-Effect Transistors (FinFETs) and Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA FETs).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of semiconductor technology has been characterized by a relentless drive towards miniaturization, following Moore's Law, which predicts that the number of transistors on a chip doubles approximately every two years. 

### Early Developments

The transition from bulk CMOS technology to sub-90nm processes began in the early 2000s. Intel's introduction of the 90nm process node in 2002 marked a significant milestone, showcasing improvements in transistor density and performance. This was followed by the 65nm node in 2006, where techniques such as high-k dielectrics and metal gates were introduced to mitigate short-channel effects and enhance device performance.

### Advancements in Fabrication Technologies

As the industry progressed to 45nm and beyond, challenges related to power leakage, heat dissipation, and variability became more pronounced. This led to the adoption of FinFET technology, first commercialized by Intel in 2011 at the 22nm node. FinFETs utilize a three-dimensional structure that allows for better electrostatic control over the channel, resulting in reduced leakage and improved performance. The industry has since moved towards even smaller nodes, including 7nm and 5nm, where extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has become a critical enabler for patterning complex features.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### 5nm Technology

The 5nm process node represents the latest commercially available technology, with companies like TSMC and Samsung leading the charge. This technology utilizes advanced FinFET architectures and EUV lithography to achieve higher transistor density and improved power efficiency.

### Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA FET)

GAA FETs, which enhance the control of the channel by wrapping the gate around it, are seen as the successor to FinFET technology. This architecture is expected to be critical for future nodes beyond 5nm, addressing challenges related to short-channel effects and variability.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography

EUV lithography is a pivotal technology in the production of sub-90nm devices. By using extremely short wavelengths of light, EUV enables the fabrication of intricate patterns with high precision, facilitating the scaling of transistor dimensions and improving yield rates.

## Major Applications

Sub-90nm technology serves as the backbone for a wide array of modern applications, including:

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

As AI algorithms increasingly demand more computational power, sub-90nm technologies enable the design of specialized processors such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) optimized for machine learning tasks.

### Networking

Advancements in networking equipment, including routers and switches, leverage sub-90nm technology to enhance data throughput and reduce latency, crucial for the expansion of 5G networks.

### Computing

High-performance computing (HPC) systems benefit from sub-90nm technology, enabling faster and more energy-efficient processors that can handle complex simulations and data analytics.

### Automotive

The automotive sector increasingly relies on sub-90nm technologies for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and electric vehicle (EV) control systems, where reliability and performance are paramount.

## Current Research Trends and Future Directions

Research in sub-90nm technology is focused on addressing the limitations of existing materials and techniques, with several key trends emerging:

### Novel Materials

The exploration of new semiconductor materials, such as gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC), is gaining momentum. These materials offer benefits in terms of thermal performance and power efficiency, making them suitable for high-performance applications.

### 3D Integration

Three-dimensional (3D) integration techniques, such as through-silicon vias (TSVs) and monolithic 3D ICs, are being investigated to improve performance and reduce form factor, allowing for greater functionality in compact designs.

### Quantum Computing

As the field of quantum computing matures, sub-90nm technology will play a critical role in fabricating qubits and associated control circuits, driving advances in this emerging field.
