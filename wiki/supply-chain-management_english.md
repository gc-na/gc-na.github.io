# Supply Chain Management (English)

## Definition of Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the comprehensive coordination and management of a network of interconnected businesses involved in the provision of product and service packages required by end customers. It encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, conversion, and logistics management, as well as the integration of these activities within and among companies. The goal of SCM is to maximize customer value and achieve a sustainable competitive advantage.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of SCM evolved from traditional logistics management practices in the 1980s, as companies sought to streamline their operations and reduce costs in response to global competition. Early SCM focused primarily on transportation and warehousing. However, technological advancements in information technology, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, have transformed SCM into a more integrated and strategic approach. The advent of the internet and advancements in data analytics have further enabled real-time tracking of goods and enhanced decision-making processes.
