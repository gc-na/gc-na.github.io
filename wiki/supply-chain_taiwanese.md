# Supply Chain (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Supply Chain

The Supply Chain can be formally defined as a network of interconnected businesses involved in the provision of products or services to consumers. This network encompasses various stages, including sourcing raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, and retail. The efficiency and effectiveness of the Supply Chain are critical for a business's success, as they directly impact production costs, product quality, and delivery timelines.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan has emerged as a pivotal player in the global Supply Chain, particularly in the semiconductor and electronics sectors. Historically, the island's rapid industrialization, initiated in the late 20th century, laid the groundwork for its current status. The establishment of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987 marked a significant milestone, as it pioneered the Foundry model, allowing design firms to outsource semiconductor manufacturing.

Technological advancements have played a crucial role in shaping the Taiwanese Supply Chain. The advent of advanced manufacturing technologies, such as automation, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), has improved operational efficiency and decision-making processes. The integration of Industry 4.0 concepts has further streamlined Supply Chain management, enabling real-time data analytics and enhanced collaboration across various stakeholders.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals
