# Switched Capacitor Circuits (English)

## Definition
Switched Capacitor Circuits (SCCs) are electronic circuits that utilize capacitors and switches to perform analog signal processing tasks. They emulate resistive behavior through the periodic charging and discharging of capacitors, allowing for the implementation of filters, amplifiers, and other linear circuit functions without the need for resistors. This technique is particularly advantageous in integrated circuit design, where area and power efficiency are critical.

## Historical Background
The concept of switched capacitor circuits emerged in the late 1970s when researchers sought methods to implement analog signal processing on integrated circuits. The pioneering work by researchers such as Gerald C. Temes and his colleagues laid the groundwork for the development of SCCs. The introduction of MOS technology allowed for the practical realization of these circuits, leading to advancements in telecommunications, audio processing, and data acquisition systems. Notably, the first commercial applications began to appear in the 1980s, with the introduction of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that incorporated SCCs for filtering and signal conditioning.

## Technological Advancements
Recent advancements in semiconductor technology have significantly enhanced the performance and capabilities of switched capacitor circuits. Innovations in process technology, such as FinFETs and SOI (Silicon On Insulator), have allowed for reduced power consumption, increased speed, and better integration with digital circuits. Furthermore, the advent of sophisticated design tools has facilitated the optimization of SCC parameters, enabling more complex and higher-performance configurations.

### Comparison: Switched Capacitor Circuits vs. Continuous Time Circuits
Switched Capacitor Circuits (SCCs) and Continuous Time Circuits (CTCs) are two fundamental approaches to analog signal processing. 

- **SCCs** utilize discrete time sampling and capacitive elements to create equivalent resistive networks, allowing for precise control of filter characteristics.
- **CTCs**, on the other hand, employ continuous voltage levels and resistors to achieve analog processing. While CTCs are generally easier to design for certain applications, SCCs offer the advantage of integration on a chip, lower sensitivity to component variations, and higher linearity.

### Engineering Fundamentals
Key engineering principles underlying SCCs include:
- **Charge Sampling**: SCCs operate by sampling the input signal and transferring charge between capacitors.
- **Frequency Response**: The design of SCCs is influenced by the sampling frequency, defining the circuits' bandwidth and stability.
- **Noise Performance**: Understanding noise sources in SCCs, including thermal noise and flicker noise, is critical for high-performance applications.

## Latest Trends
Current trends in SCC technology focus on enhancing integration and functionality. Multi-bit switched capacitor converters, which allow for improved resolution in digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion, are gaining popularity. Additionally, the integration of SCCs with digital circuits is enabling the development of more compact and efficient System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, catering to the growing demands of mobile and IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
