# System Integration (Taiwanese)

## Definition of System Integration
System Integration refers to the process of bringing together various subsystems and components into a single, cohesive operational system. This involves the integration of hardware and software, thereby ensuring that they function together seamlessly. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, system integration plays a critical role in developing complex electronic devices that require multiple functionalities to operate effectively.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
The evolution of system integration can be traced back to the early days of electronics when discrete components were connected manually, leading to inefficiencies and increased complexity. With the advent of integrated circuits (ICs) in the 1960s, the semiconductor industry began to focus on miniaturization and integration of components, which laid the groundwork for modern VLSI systems.

Taiwan emerged as a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing in the late 20th century, with significant investments in technology and infrastructure. Companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and MediaTek have been pivotal in advancing system integration techniques, focusing on high-density packaging and efficient design methodologies.
