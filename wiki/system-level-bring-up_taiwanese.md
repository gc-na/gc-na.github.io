# System-Level Bring-up (Taiwanese)

## Definition of System-Level Bring-up

System-Level Bring-up refers to the initial stage of testing and validating a newly developed system, focusing on the integration and performance of hardware components, software interfaces, and overall system functionality. This process is critical in the lifecycle of electronic products, particularly in semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, as it ensures that all components work harmoniously to meet design specifications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of System-Level Bring-up has evolved alongside the rapid advancements in semiconductor technology. Historically, the semiconductor industry has witnessed the transition from discrete components to integrated circuits, and later, to complex System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. The advent of VLSI systems in the 1970s marked a significant milestone, allowing for the integration of millions of transistors on a single chip. This shift necessitated the development of sophisticated testing methodologies and tools for effective bring-up processes.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry gained momentum in the late 1980s, with companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) leading the way in foundry services. As Taiwanese firms began to adopt advanced manufacturing techniques, the importance of a robust System-Level Bring-up process became evident, paving the way for innovative methodologies to streamline this phase.
