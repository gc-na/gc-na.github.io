# System on Chip (SoC) (English)

## Definition of System on Chip (SoC)

A System on Chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that consolidates various components of a computer or other electronic system into a single chip. These components typically include a central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM and ROM), input/output ports, and sometimes additional features such as graphics processing units (GPUs), digital signal processors (DSPs), and various peripherals. The primary advantage of an SoC is its ability to reduce physical space, power consumption, and manufacturing costs while enhancing performance and efficiency.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of integrating multiple functions into a single chip emerged in the late 20th century. Early examples of SoCs can be traced back to the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) in the 1980s. However, it was not until the 1990s that advancements in semiconductor technology, such as the introduction of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, enabled the practical implementation of SoCs for consumer electronics.

The 2000s saw significant advancements, driven by the rise of mobile computing and the demand for compact, efficient devices. Notable milestones during this period include the emergence of mobile SoCs, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon and the Apple A-series chips, which integrated multiple functionalities into a single chip, providing enhanced performance for smartphones and tablets.
