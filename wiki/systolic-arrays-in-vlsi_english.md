# Systolic Arrays in VLSI (English)

## Definition of Systolic Arrays in VLSI

Systolic arrays are specialized hardware architectures designed for efficient data processing in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. These arrays consist of a network of interconnected processing elements (PEs) that rhythmically process data streams in a synchronized manner. The term "systolic" is derived from the rhythmic contraction of the heart, which metaphorically represents the coordinated data flow through the array. Systolic arrays are particularly effective for applications that require high throughput and low latency, making them suitable for tasks such as matrix multiplication, convolution operations, and digital signal processing.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of systolic arrays was first introduced by H.T. Kung in the early 1980s, primarily as a solution to the growing need for efficient parallel processing capabilities in computing. The initial designs focused on matrix operations, which are fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering applications. Over the years, advancements in semiconductor technology, particularly with the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), enabled the realization of more complex and compact systolic array designs.

The evolution of VLSI technology has led to significant improvements in the performance and scalability of systolic arrays. Key technological advancements include the transition from  CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) to FinFET (Fin Field-Effect Transistor) technologies, and more recently, to Gate-All-Around (GAA) FET structures. These innovations have allowed for higher transistor density, reduced power consumption, and enhanced performance metrics. Additionally, the introduction of Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) has played a pivotal role in enabling smaller feature sizes, further advancing the capabilities of systolic arrays.
