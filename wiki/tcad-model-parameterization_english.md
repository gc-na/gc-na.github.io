# TCAD Model Parameterization (English)

## Definition of TCAD Model Parameterization

TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design) Model Parameterization is the process of defining and adjusting the parameters that characterize the physical and electrical behavior of semiconductor devices within TCAD simulations. This involves the extraction of model parameters from experimental data and the calibration of simulation models to ensure they accurately reflect real-world performance. The primary objective is to enhance the predictive capabilities of TCAD tools, facilitating the design and optimization of semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, and systems on chip (SoCs).

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The roots of TCAD can be traced back to the early 1980s, emerging from the need for sophisticated simulation tools to assist in semiconductor device design. Initial models focused on simple structures and processes, but as semiconductor technology progressed towards smaller nodes and more complex architectures, the demand for more accurate and comprehensive models grew. Over the decades, advancements in computational capabilities and numerical methods have significantly broadened the scope of TCAD, leading to the development of advanced physical models that incorporate quantum effects, doping profiles, and stress phenomena.

### Semiconductor Device Physics

Understanding semiconductor device physics is fundamental to TCAD Model Parameterization. Key principles, such as band theory, carrier transport, and recombination mechanisms, underpin the behavior of devices modeled in TCAD simulations. Parameters such as mobility, saturation velocity, and junction capacitance are critical for accurate simulations.

### Process Simulation

Process simulation complements TCAD by modeling the fabrication steps of semiconductor devices, including ion implantation, diffusion, and oxidation. Accurate process models are essential for parameterizing device models, as the physical characteristics of the devices are highly dependent on the manufacturing processes.

### Circuit Simulation

Once TCAD models are parameterized, they can be integrated into circuit simulation tools, allowing for the evaluation of entire systems. This is particularly important in the design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs).
