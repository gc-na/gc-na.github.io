# Technology Modeling (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Technology Modeling

Technology Modeling refers to the systematic representation and simulation of semiconductor technologies and their inherent processes. It encompasses various methodologies, including physical modeling, behavioral modeling, and performance modeling, to predict the behavior and efficiency of semiconductor devices and circuits under different conditions. This approach is essential for designing, optimizing, and verifying complex VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, ensuring that the final product meets both functional and performance specifications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of Technology Modeling can be traced back to the early days of semiconductor development in the mid-20th century. As semiconductor technology progressed, particularly with the advent of integrated circuits, the need for accurate models became apparent. Initial models were largely empirical, based on observed performance metrics. However, with advancements in computational power and simulation tools, more sophisticated models emerged.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor industry gained prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, fueled by government initiatives and foreign investments. Taiwanese companies like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) began to leverage advanced technology modeling techniques to enhance their manufacturing processes and design capabilities. This laid the groundwork for Taiwan to become a global leader in semiconductor fabrication and VLSI systems.
