# Technology Nodes (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Technology Nodes

Technology nodes, also known as process nodes, refer to the manufacturing process used in semiconductor fabrication that defines the minimum feature size of transistors on a chip. Typically measured in nanometers (nm), these nodes indicate advancements in semiconductor technology, where smaller features generally lead to higher performance, lower power consumption, and increased transistor density. For example, a 5nm technology node signifies that the smallest half-pitch of contactable features is 5nm.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of technology nodes has been a critical aspect of semiconductor technology since the inception of integrated circuits (ICs) in the 1960s. Early nodes like 10 micrometers (µm) have evolved to the current sub-5nm nodes due to advancements in photolithography, materials science, and design methodologies.

### Key Milestones in Technology Nodes

1. **1970s**: The introduction of CMOS technology allowed scaling down to 1µm and below, increasing device performance and reducing power consumption.
2. **1990s**: The advent of deep submicron technology led to nodes such as 180nm and 130nm, driven by advancements in optical lithography and etching techniques.
3. **2000s**: The transition to 90nm and 65nm technology nodes saw the introduction of High-k/Metal Gate (HKMG) technology, which improved transistor performance while reducing leakage currents.
4. **2010s**: The introduction of FinFET structures at the 22nm node marked a significant shift in transistor architecture, enhancing performance and power efficiency.
5. **2020s**: The industry is now transitioning to 5nm and even 3nm nodes, where extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography plays a crucial role in enabling the fabrication of smaller features.
