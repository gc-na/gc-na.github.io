# Technology Transfer (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Technology Transfer

Technology Transfer refers to the process of transferring skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, and facilities among governments and other institutions. It encompasses the transition of technological innovations from research and development (R&D) environments to practical applications in industry, including the commercialization of technologies. In the context of Taiwan, this process is vital for fostering economic growth and enhancing competitiveness in global markets.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

Taiwan's journey in technology transfer began in the late 20th century, particularly following the establishment of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in 1973. ITRI played a crucial role in bridging the gap between academic research and commercial applications, spearheading initiatives in semiconductor technology, information technology, and biotechnology.

### Key Milestones in Taiwanese Technology Transfer

- **1970s-1980s:** The establishment of key institutions such as ITRI and partnerships with multinational corporations facilitated the transfer of technology necessary for the development of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.
- **1990s:** Taiwan's emergence as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in the production of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and System on Chips (SoCs), was largely due to effective technology transfer strategies.
- **2000s:** The Taiwanese government implemented policies promoting research commercialization and the creation of technology parks, further enhancing technology transfer capabilities.

### Semiconductor Technology

Semiconductor technology is a core area where technology transfer is particularly significant. The fabrication of devices such as MOSFETs and integrated circuits relies on sophisticated processes that require both technical expertise and cutting-edge equipment. Taiwan's TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) exemplifies how effective technology transfer can lead to global leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.

### VLSI Systems

Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems represent another critical area of technology transfer. As the complexity of integrated circuits increases, so does the need for advanced design methodologies and tools. The collaboration between academia and industry in Taiwan has been instrumental in developing innovative VLSI design techniques and tools, fostering a competitive edge in the global market.
