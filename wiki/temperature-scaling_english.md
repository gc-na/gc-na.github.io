# Temperature Scaling (English)

## Definition of Temperature Scaling

Temperature Scaling is a technique used in the field of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems to optimize circuit performance by adjusting the operational temperature of semiconductor devices. This adjustment aims to enhance reliability, reduce power consumption, and mitigate the effects of temperature-induced variations in electrical characteristics. The fundamental principle of Temperature Scaling revolves around the relationship between temperature and semiconductor behavior, where variations in temperature can significantly impact parameters such as mobility, threshold voltage, and leakage current.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Temperature Scaling has evolved alongside the semiconductor industry, particularly as devices have transitioned to smaller geometries and higher densities. Early work in the 1980s focused on the thermal characteristics of integrated circuits, as the need for efficient cooling solutions became apparent with the rise of microprocessor technology. 

Significant advancements were made in the 1990s with the introduction of thermal management techniques, including heat sinks and active cooling methods. The development of new materials, such as high thermal conductivity substrates, also enabled more effective heat dissipation. More recently, the advent of advanced packaging technologies, including System-in-Package (SiP) and 3D integration, has further facilitated the implementation of Temperature Scaling strategies.
