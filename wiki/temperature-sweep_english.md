# Temperature Sweep (English)

## Definition of Temperature Sweep

A **Temperature Sweep** is a systematic experimentation technique used in semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems to analyze the performance characteristics of materials, devices, and circuits over a range of temperatures. This process involves varying the temperature of a sample while monitoring specific electrical or physical properties, such as resistance, capacitance, and leakage current. The primary objective is to understand how temperature fluctuations affect device behavior, reliability, and overall performance.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of temperature dependence in semiconductor materials dates back to the early days of solid-state physics. Initial studies focused on the behavior of intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors under thermal stress. Over the decades, advancements in fabrication techniques, such as the development of CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology, have enabled the miniaturization of devices, necessitating more sophisticated temperature sweep methods to ensure device reliability and performance under varying operational conditions.

The introduction of automated test equipment (ATE) in the late 20th century revolutionized the temperature sweep process, allowing for more precise and efficient data collection. Recent advancements in simulation software and thermal imaging have further enhanced the ability to perform temperature sweeps, providing engineers with tools to predict device behavior under thermal stress without extensive physical testing.
