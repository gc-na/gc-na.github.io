# Test Wrapper (English)

## Definition of Test Wrapper

A Test Wrapper is a specialized interface or layer designed to facilitate the testing of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in the context of digital and analog applications. It acts as a bridge between the test equipment and the device under test (DUT), enabling the application of test stimuli and capturing the resultant responses. The primary purpose of a Test Wrapper is to enhance the testability of an IC while minimizing the impact on its overall performance and functionality.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of the Test Wrapper emerged in the 1990s as semiconductor manufacturers recognized the need for efficient testing methodologies amid increasing design complexities. With the advent of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and high-density VLSI systems, traditional testing approaches became inadequate. This led to the development of standardized test wrappers, such as the IEEE 1149.1 Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture (JTAG), which provided a systematic way to access internal nodes of chips for testing purposes.

In recent years, advancements in semiconductor technology, such as the proliferation of System on Chip (SoC) designs and the growing demand for reduced time-to-market, have further driven the evolution of Test Wrappers. Modern Test Wrappers are now being designed with capabilities to support high-speed testing, built-in self-test (BIST) features, and advanced fault diagnosis techniques.

### Test Access Mechanisms

Test Wrappers are often categorized under various test access mechanisms (TAMs), which include:

- **Boundary-Scan Testing:** Utilizes JTAG to control and observe the state of pins and internal circuitry of the IC.
- **Built-In Self-Test (BIST):** Integrates test logic within the IC itself, allowing for autonomous testing without external equipment.
- **Scan Chain Testing:** Involves the inclusion of additional flip-flops to create a shift register capable of capturing and shifting out test data.
