# Testability Analysis (Taiwanese)

## 定義
Testability Analysis refers to the systematic evaluation of a system's ability to be tested effectively and efficiently. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) systems, it involves assessing the designs of integrated circuits (ICs) to ensure that they can be thoroughly tested for functionality, performance, and reliability. High testability means that faults can be detected with minimal cost and time, significantly impacting the overall quality and yield of semiconductor products.

## 歷史背景與技術進步
The concept of testability analysis emerged alongside the growth of digital electronics in the 1970s. As technology advanced, particularly with the advent of VLSI systems in the 1980s, the complexity of IC designs increased, leading to a greater need for effective testing methodologies. Historically, significant milestones include the development of Built-In Self-Test (BIST) techniques and Design for Testability (DFT) practices, which have continually evolved to improve fault coverage and reduce testing time.

## 相關技術與工程基礎
Testability analysis relies on various engineering fundamentals and related technologies, including:

### Design for Testability (DFT)
DFT encompasses a set of design practices that enhance the ease of testing electronic systems. Techniques such as scan chains, boundary scan, and the incorporation of test points are common methods used to improve testability.

### Test Generation Techniques
Test generation involves creating a set of inputs that will effectively stimulate the circuit to identify potential faults. Techniques include:
- Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)
- Fault simulation
