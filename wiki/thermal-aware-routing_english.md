# Thermal-aware Routing (English)

## Definition

Thermal-aware routing refers to the design methodology employed in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems that considers thermal distribution and its implications during the routing process. It aims to optimize the layout of interconnections in integrated circuits (ICs) while minimizing temperature-induced effects that can lead to performance degradation, reliability issues, and increased power consumption. By integrating thermal considerations into the routing process, designers can ensure that the heat generated by active components is efficiently dissipated, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the semiconductor devices.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The significance of thermal management in semiconductor devices has been recognized since the advent of integrated circuits. In the early 1990s, as IC technology advanced towards deeper sub-micrometer nodes, the effects of heat on device performance became increasingly critical. Traditional routing techniques often neglected thermal considerations, leading to localized hotspots and thermal gradients that adversely affected the reliability and longevity of chips.

As a response to these challenges, researchers began to develop thermal-aware methodologies. The introduction of advanced thermal modeling techniques, such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), allowed for a more accurate prediction of temperature distribution across ICs. These advancements laid the groundwork for the development of thermal-aware routing algorithms.
