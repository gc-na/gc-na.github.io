# Thermal-aware Routing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Thermal-aware Routing

Thermal-aware routing refers to the methodologies employed in the design and optimization of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in the context of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, to mitigate thermal issues arising from power dissipation. The primary objective is to enhance the thermal performance of the chip by considering temperature effects during the routing process. This includes strategically placing interconnections and using routing algorithms that accommodate thermal gradients and hotspots to prevent thermal-induced failures and performance degradation.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of thermal-aware routing emerged in the early 2000s as IC designs began to scale down in size while increasing in complexity and power density. As transistors became smaller and more densely packed, the heat generated by high-performance chips led to significant challenges in maintaining optimal operating temperatures. Early methods primarily focused on passive cooling solutions, but the need for more proactive thermal management strategies spurred advancements in thermal-aware design techniques.

Technological innovations such as FinFET transistors and advanced packaging technologies, including 3D ICs, have further complicated thermal management, creating a pressing need for integrated thermal-aware routing methodologies. Recent developments in computational algorithms and machine learning have also played a critical role, allowing for more efficient and effective thermal-aware routing solutions.
