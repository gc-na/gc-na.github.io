# Thermal Management (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Thermal Management

Thermal Management refers to the process of controlling and maintaining the temperature of electronic devices and systems to ensure optimal performance and reliability. In the context of semiconductor technology and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems, effective thermal management is crucial to prevent overheating, which can lead to reduced efficiency, malfunction, or permanent damage to components.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The evolution of thermal management techniques can be traced back to the early days of electronics, where passive cooling methods, such as heat sinks and ventilation, were primarily employed. However, as semiconductor devices became more compact and powerful, generating higher levels of heat, the need for more advanced thermal management solutions arose.

In Taiwan, a significant player in the global semiconductor industry, advancements in thermal management technologies have paralleled the rapid development of VLSI systems. The introduction of active cooling techniques, such as liquid cooling and thermoelectric coolers, has allowed for more effective heat dissipation, enabling the miniaturization of electronic components without compromising performance.
