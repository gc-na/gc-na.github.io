# Thermal Testing (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Thermal Testing

Thermal Testing refers to the systematic evaluation of a semiconductor device’s thermal performance under various conditions to ensure reliability and functionality. This process involves measuring the temperature distribution, heat dissipation, and thermal resistance of integrated circuits (ICs) and other electronic components. The primary objective is to verify that the device can operate within specified thermal limits, thereby preventing overheating and potential failure.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The importance of thermal management in semiconductor technology has grown significantly since the inception of integrated circuits in the 1960s. Early thermal testing methods were rudimentary, often relying on thermocouples and infrared cameras for temperature measurements. With the advent of more sophisticated semiconductor materials and packaging techniques, such as flip-chip and ball grid array (BGA), the demand for precise thermal testing methodologies has increased.

Technological advancements in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, including the development of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and infrared thermography, have enabled engineers to predict thermal behavior more accurately. The integration of these technologies into the design and testing phases has greatly enhanced the thermal performance of devices.
