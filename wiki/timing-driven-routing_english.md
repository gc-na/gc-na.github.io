# Timing-driven Routing (English)

## Definition of Timing-driven Routing

Timing-driven routing is a critical process in the design of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly in the realm of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). It involves the optimization of interconnect pathways to ensure that signal propagation delays meet specified timing constraints. Timing-driven routing aims to minimize the overall delay of signals while satisfying design rules, enhancing performance, and reducing power consumption in high-density VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The need for timing-driven routing emerged with the increasing complexity of semiconductor devices in the late 20th century. Early routing techniques primarily focused on aesthetic layout and basic design rule adherence, often neglecting timing considerations. As clock speeds increased and design complexities escalated, designers recognized the necessity of timing optimization.

In the 1990s, advancements in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools introduced algorithms that integrated timing analysis into the routing phase. These tools allowed designers to evaluate the timing of paths dynamically, leading to more effective use of resources and improved performance metrics. Over the years, enhanced algorithms, such as Global and Detailed Routing techniques, have been developed to refine timing-driven routing.

### Global vs. Detailed Routing

Timing-driven routing can be compared to conventional routing techniques in terms of their objectives and methodologies:

- **Global Routing:** This phase determines the approximate routes for signals across the entire chip, focusing on minimizing congestion without detailed consideration of timing.

- **Detailed Routing:** This phase finalizes the routing paths, taking into account the specific layers and geometries of the interconnects. Timing-driven routing is often applied in this stage to ensure that critical paths meet their timing requirements.

### Related Technologies

1. **Static Timing Analysis (STA):** STA is a method used to check timing violations without requiring dynamic simulations. It plays a crucial role in timing-driven routing by identifying critical paths that need special attention.

2. **Place and Route (P&R):** The P&R process encompasses both the placement of components and the routing of interconnects. Timing-driven routing is a subset of this process, emphasizing the timing constraints during the routing stage.

3. **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):** This technique focuses on the design of clock distribution networks, directly impacting timing. Timing-driven routing often incorporates considerations from CTS to ensure that clock signals meet timing requirements.
