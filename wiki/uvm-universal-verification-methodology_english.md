# UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) (English)

## Definition of UVM

The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is a standardized methodology for verifying integrated circuit designs. Developed by Accellera, UVM provides a comprehensive framework for creating reusable verification components, testbenches, and environments. This methodology facilitates the development of complex verification environments and promotes best practices in hardware verification, allowing engineers to ensure that designs meet specified requirements and perform reliably under various conditions.

## Historical Background

The roots of UVM can be traced back to earlier verification methodologies such as the Open Vera and eRM (e Reusable Methodology). In 2000, the Accellera organization sought to create a unified methodology that could incorporate the strengths of different verification approaches and promote interoperability between tools and components. UVM was officially released in 2012, becoming the de facto standard for SystemVerilog-based verification.

Since its inception, UVM has undergone several revisions, each introducing enhancements that address the evolving complexities of semiconductor design and verification. With the shift toward smaller process nodes and increasing design complexities, UVM has adapted to support advanced verification techniques, including constrained random testing, coverage-driven verification, and assertions.
