# Verification Methodology (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Verification Methodology is a structured approach used in the design and development of electronic systems, particularly in the realm of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). It comprises a set of techniques and processes aimed at ensuring that a system or component meets its specifications and is free of defects. The emphasis is placed on rigorous testing and validation to confirm that the design behaves as intended under all expected operating conditions.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The roots of Verification Methodology can be traced back to the early days of integrated circuit design in the 1970s when the complexity of designs began to exceed the capabilities of manual verification methods. As technology progressed, the emergence of simulation tools and formal verification techniques paved the way for more systematic methodologies. The adoption of languages such as VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and Verilog for modeling hardware further advanced verification practices. In the 1990s, the introduction of SystemVerilog brought along verification constructs that significantly enhanced the ability to model and verify complex designs.

## 相關技術與工程基礎

### 硬件描述語言 (HDL)
Hardware Description Languages like VHDL and Verilog are essential for defining the structure and behavior of electronic systems. They provide the groundwork upon which verification methodologies are built.

### 模擬與形式驗證
Simulation techniques allow engineers to test designs under various scenarios, providing a dynamic insight into their behavior. On the other hand, formal verification employs mathematical methods to prove the correctness of a design, offering a complementary approach to traditional simulation.

### 測試基準與驗證計劃
Establishing robust testbenches and verification plans is crucial. These frameworks guide the testing process and help ensure comprehensive coverage of the design specifications.
