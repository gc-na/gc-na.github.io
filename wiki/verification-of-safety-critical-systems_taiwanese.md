# Verification of Safety-Critical Systems (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Verification of Safety-Critical Systems

Verification of Safety-Critical Systems refers to the process of evaluating and ensuring that systems, particularly those used in sectors where failure can lead to catastrophic consequences (such as automotive, aerospace, healthcare, and industrial automation), consistently meet safety standards and performance requirements. This involves rigorous testing, analysis, and validation methodologies to confirm that systems operate safely under specified conditions throughout their operational lifecycle.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of safety-critical systems has its roots in the aerospace and nuclear industries, where the stakes of system failure are exceedingly high. The introduction of formal verification methods in the 1970s laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated safety assurance techniques. Notably, the development of the IEEE 1012 standard for software verification and validation in the late 1980s marked a significant advancement in establishing systematic approaches to safety verification.

In Taiwan, the semiconductor and electronics sectors have rapidly evolved over the past few decades, driving advancements in verification methodologies. As the demand for complex systems integrated with Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in safety-critical applications has grown, so has the need for robust verification techniques.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Formal Methods

Formal methods encompass mathematical techniques for the specification, development, and verification of software and hardware systems. They provide a foundation for proving the correctness of algorithms concerning certain specifications, essential in safety-critical applications.

### Model Checking

Model checking is an automated verification technique that systematically explores the possible states of a system model. It is particularly effective for verifying finite-state systems and is widely used in hardware verification.

### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

FTA is a top-down, deductive failure analysis that maps out the various paths to system failure, helping identify potential weaknesses in safety-critical designs.

### Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing

HIL testing integrates real-time simulation of physical systems with hardware components to validate the interaction of control algorithms and hardware. This approach is invaluable for systems that operate in dynamic environments.

## Latest Trends

### Increasing Automation in Verification Processes

Automation in verification processes, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), is becoming increasingly prevalent. These technologies facilitate faster and more efficient testing and analysis, allowing engineers to identify issues earlier in the development cycle.

### Adoption of Safety Standards

The adoption of international safety standards, such as ISO 26262 for automotive safety and DO-178C for aerospace software, is becoming more common in Taiwan. Compliance with these standards ensures that safety-critical systems meet industry-specific requirements.

### Shift Towards Cyber-Physical Systems

With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), the verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has gained prominence. These systems integrate computation, networking, and physical processes, necessitating comprehensive verification approaches to ensure their reliability and safety.
