# Video Processing (Taiwanese)

## 定義

Video Processing refers to the manipulation and analysis of video signals to enhance, compress, or extract information from visual content. This field encompasses various techniques aimed at improving the quality or efficiency of video data, applying algorithms for tasks such as filtering, encoding, and decoding. The ultimate goal of video processing is to optimize the representation of visual information for both storage and transmission, ensuring high-quality playback on various devices.

## 歷史背景與技術進步

The origins of Video Processing can be traced back to the early days of television and film, where basic techniques for signal manipulation were developed. Over the decades, advancements in semiconductor technology, particularly the development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), have significantly enhanced the capabilities of video processing systems.

In the 1990s, the transition from analog to digital video marked a significant milestone. This shift enabled the use of powerful algorithms for compression and enhancement, such as MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) standards, which allowed for efficient storage and transmission of video data. The advent of high-definition (HD) and later ultra-high-definition (UHD) video formats further propelled the development of sophisticated video processing techniques.
