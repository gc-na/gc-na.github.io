# Wafer Fabrication (English)

## Definition of Wafer Fabrication

Wafer Fabrication is a critical process in the semiconductor manufacturing industry that involves the production of semiconductor wafers from raw materials, typically silicon. This multi-step process transforms raw silicon into integrated circuits (ICs) through a series of photolithographic, etching, doping, and chemical processes. The outcome is a wafer containing multiple functional electronic devices, including transistors, diodes, and resistors, which can be further diced into individual chips for various applications.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The origins of wafer fabrication can be traced back to the 1950s, coinciding with the advent of the transistor. The first commercial silicon wafers were produced in the late 1960s, marking a significant milestone in the electronics industry. The introduction of photolithography, which allowed for precise patterning of circuit elements, revolutionized the field. Over the decades, advancements in materials science, precision engineering, and process automation have led to the development of smaller, more efficient, and powerful semiconductor devices.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Photolithography

Photolithography is a fundamental technique in wafer fabrication, used to transfer circuit patterns onto the silicon wafer. It involves the application of a photosensitive resist material, exposure to ultraviolet light through a mask, and subsequent development to reveal the desired pattern.

### Etching

Etching is used to remove layers of material to create the desired structures on the wafer. This process can be classified into two main types: wet etching, which uses chemical solutions, and dry etching, which employs gases in a plasma state.

### Doping

Doping is the process of intentionally introducing impurities into the silicon wafer to modify its electrical properties. This step is critical for creating p-type and n-type semiconductors, which are essential for forming transistors.

### Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP)

CMP is a process used to achieve planarization of the wafer surface, ensuring that subsequent layers can be deposited evenly. It combines chemical etching and mechanical abrasion to smooth the surface.
