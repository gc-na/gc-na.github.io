# Wafer Fabrication (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Wafer Fabrication

Wafer Fabrication is the process of creating integrated circuits (ICs) on a silicon wafer using a series of sophisticated steps that involve photolithography, etching, doping, and deposition. This essential process is a cornerstone of semiconductor manufacturing, enabling the production of various electronic components, including microprocessors, memory chips, and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The fabrication process transforms a raw silicon wafer into a highly complex microelectronic device, characterized by millions or even billions of transistors interconnected through intricate circuitry.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

### Early Developments

Wafer fabrication has its roots in the early 1960s when researchers began to explore the potential of silicon as a semiconductor material. The introduction of the planar process by Jean Hoerni in 1959 marked a significant technological advancement, allowing for the development of the first integrated circuits. This innovation laid the groundwork for the modern semiconductor industry.

### Taiwanese Semiconductor Evolution

Taiwan emerged as a major player in the global semiconductor market in the 1980s, with the establishment of companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in 1987. Over the years, Taiwan's wafer fabrication capabilities have grown in sophistication, leading to advancements such as Deep Submicron (DSM) technology and FinFET architecture, which have considerably improved device performance and energy efficiency.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Photolithography

Photolithography is a critical process in wafer fabrication, involving the application of a light-sensitive photoresist material to the wafer's surface. A light source is used to expose specific patterns onto the photoresist, which is then developed to create a mask for subsequent etching or deposition processes.

### Etching Technologies

Etching is the process of removing layers of material from the wafer to create the desired circuit patterns. This can be categorized into two main types: wet etching, which uses liquid chemicals, and dry etching, which employs plasma or reactive ion processes for more precise control.

### Doping

Doping involves the introduction of impurities into the silicon to alter its electrical properties. This process is crucial for creating p-type and n-type semiconductors, which are the building blocks of transistors.

## Latest Trends in Wafer Fabrication
