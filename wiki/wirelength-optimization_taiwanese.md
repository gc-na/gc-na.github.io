# Wirelength Optimization (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Wirelength Optimization

Wirelength Optimization refers to the process of minimizing the total length of interconnect wires in Integrated Circuit (IC) designs, particularly in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems. The aim is to enhance performance metrics such as signal delay, power consumption, and overall manufacturing efficiency. By strategically arranging components and optimizing their interconnections, engineers can significantly reduce the parasitic capacitance and resistance, leading to faster and more efficient circuits.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of Wirelength Optimization dates back to the early days of semiconductor technology, with its roots embedded in the challenges faced during the transition from discrete components to integrated circuits. The growing complexity of designs necessitated sophisticated methods to manage the interconnects effectively. 

### Early Techniques

Initially, Wirelength Optimization was addressed through manual routing techniques. As designs became more intricate, algorithms were developed, leading to the advent of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in the 1980s. These tools incorporated techniques such as linear programming and heuristic algorithms for routing optimization.

### Advances in Algorithms and Tools

With advancements in computational power and algorithm design, various optimization techniques have emerged, including:

- **Global Routing Algorithms:** These methods optimize the routing across the entire chip before local adjustments.
