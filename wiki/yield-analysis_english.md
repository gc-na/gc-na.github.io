# Yield Analysis (English)

## Definition of Yield Analysis
Yield Analysis is a critical process in semiconductor manufacturing that quantifies the production efficiency of integrated circuits (ICs) or other semiconductor devices. It is defined as the ratio of the number of functional devices produced to the total number of devices fabricated in a manufacturing lot, typically expressed as a percentage. High yield signifies a more efficient manufacturing process, while low yield indicates potential issues in fabrication, design, or materials.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements
Yield Analysis has evolved significantly since the inception of semiconductor manufacturing in the mid-20th century. The early days of semiconductor production saw yields as low as 10%, primarily due to the rudimentary fabrication techniques and the nascent understanding of material properties. 

As technology progressed, so did the methodologies for yield analysis. The introduction of Statistical Process Control (SPC) in the 1980s allowed engineers to monitor and control production processes systematically. The shift from planar transistors to more advanced structures, such as FinFETs in the 2010s, necessitated more sophisticated yield analysis techniques due to their complex geometries. 

Recent advancements in technology, such as Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, have further pushed the boundaries of yield analysis. EUV enables the fabrication of smaller nodes (e.g., 7nm and 5nm) with higher precision, potentially increasing yield but also introducing new challenges that require advanced analytical methods.

## Related Technologies and Latest Trends

### 5nm Technology Node
The 5nm technology node represents a significant leap in semiconductor fabrication, promising enhanced performance and energy efficiency. Yield analysis at this scale involves rigorous testing of lithography processes, patterning techniques, and defect inspection strategies to ensure high production yields.

### Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistor (GAA FET)
Gate-All-Around (GAA) FET technology is emerging as a successor to FinFETs, providing superior electrostatic control over the channel. Yield analysis in GAA structures requires new modeling techniques to account for the increased complexity and variability in device performance.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography
EUV lithography has revolutionized the way semiconductor devices are manufactured, enabling the scaling down of features to the atomic level. Yield analysis must adapt to the unique challenges posed by EUV, including issues related to mask defects and process variability.

## Major Applications

### Computing
Yield analysis is vital in the computing sector, where high-performance processors are essential for handling complex computations. Improved yields reduce costs and improve the performance-to-price ratio of processors used in personal computers and data centers.

### Automotive
With the increasing reliance on semiconductor technology in automotive applications, including autonomous vehicles, yield analysis ensures that components meet stringent safety and reliability standards. High yields in automotive chips are essential for reducing costs and enhancing performance.
