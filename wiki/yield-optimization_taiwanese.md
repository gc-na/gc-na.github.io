# Yield Optimization (Taiwanese)

## Definition of Yield Optimization

Yield Optimization refers to a systematic approach employed in semiconductor manufacturing and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) systems to enhance the number of functional devices produced from a batch of silicon wafers. Yield is defined as the ratio of the number of good chips produced to the total number of chips fabricated, expressed as a percentage. High yield is critical in reducing costs and maximizing profitability in semiconductor production.

## Historical Background and Technological Advancements

The concept of yield optimization in semiconductor manufacturing emerged in the late 20th century alongside the rapid evolution of integrated circuit technology. Initially, the yield rates were low due to defects in photolithography, etching, and doping processes. As the industry progressed, advancements in photolithography, chemical mechanical polishing, and defect inspection technologies significantly improved yield rates.

During the 1990s and early 2000s, the introduction of Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles began to influence yield optimization efforts. DFM focuses on the design aspects that can improve manufacturability and, consequently, yield. More recently, the advent of advanced lithography techniques, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, has further propelled yield optimization by allowing the fabrication of smaller and more complex features on chips.

## Related Technologies and Engineering Fundamentals

### Design for Manufacturability (DFM)

DFM is a crucial aspect of yield optimization. By integrating manufacturability considerations into the design phase, engineers can mitigate potential yield-impacting issues early in the design process. This includes optimizing layout geometries, reducing critical dimensions, and ensuring adequate spacing between features.

### Process Control and Statistical Process Control (SPC)

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is employed to monitor and control manufacturing processes. By utilizing statistical methods, manufacturers can detect variations in the production process that may lead to defects, enabling them to take corrective actions before significant yield losses occur.

### Advanced Inspection Techniques

Modern semiconductor fabrication employs various inspection techniques, such as optical and electron-beam inspection, to detect defects at various stages of the manufacturing process. These technologies provide critical feedback that informs yield optimization strategies.
